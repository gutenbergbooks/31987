<p>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:<br />
There are a large number of compound words in
this book including bird names which occur joined,
spaced and hyphenated. No attempt has been made to
correct these discrepancies as these are mostly
alternative spellingd of thw same word. In the case of bird names it
is difficult to decide as ornithologists are
still debating on this subject.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>When studying the Warblers some twenty
years ago, I became aware of the fact that
each male isolates itself at the commencement
of the breeding season and exercises dominion
over a restricted area of ground. Further investigation,
pursued with a view to ascertaining
the relation of this particular mode of behaviour
to the system of reproduction, led to my studying
various species, not only those of close affinity,
but those widely remote in the tree of avian
life. The present work is the outcome of
those investigations. In it I have endeavoured
to interpret the prospective value of the behaviour,
and to trace out the relationships in
the organic and inorganic world which have
determined its survival. Much is mere speculation;
much with fuller knowledge may be
found to be wrong. But I venture to hope
that a nucleus will remain upon which a more
complete territorial system may one day be
established.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span></p>

<p>I have to thank Mr. G. E. Lodge and Mr.
H. Gr&ouml;nvold for the trouble they have taken
in executing my wishes; I also want to record
my indebtedness to the late E. W. Hopewell;
and to Professor Lloyd Morgan, F.R.S., I am
beholden more than I can tell.</p>

<h2>TERRITORY IN BIRD LIFE</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


<p>In his <i>Manual of Psychology</i> Dr Stout reminds
us that "Human language is especially constructed
to describe the mental states of human
beings, and this means that it is especially
constructed so as to mislead us when we attempt
to describe the working of minds that differ in
a great degree from the human."</p>

<p>The use of the word "territory" in connection
with the sexual life of birds is open to
the danger which we are here asked to guard
against, and I propose, therefore, before attempting
to establish the theory on general grounds,
to give some explanation of what the word is
intended to represent and some account of the
exact position that representation is supposed to
occupy in the drama of bird life.</p>

<p>The word is capable of much expansion.
There cannot be territories without boundaries
of some description; there cannot well be
boundaries without disputes arising as to those
boundaries; nor, one would imagine, can there
be disputes without consciousness as a factor
entering into the situation; and so on, until by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
a simple mental process we conceive of a state
in bird life analogous to that which we know
to be customary amongst ourselves. Now,
although the term "breeding territory," when
applied to the sexual life of birds, is not altogether
a happy one, it is difficult to know
how otherwise to give expression to the facts
observed. Let it then be clearly understood that
the expression "securing a territory" is used to
denote a process, or rather part of a process,
which, in order to insure success to the individual
in the attainment of reproduction, has
been gradually evolved to meet the exigencies
of diverse circumstances. Regarded thus, we
avoid the risk of conceiving of the act of securing
a territory as a detached event in the life of a
bird, and avoid, I hope, the risk of a conception
based upon the meaning of the word when
used to describe human as opposed to animal
procedure.</p>

<p>Success in the attainment of reproduction is
rightly considered to be the goal towards which
many processes in nature are tending. But
what is meant by success? Is it determined by
the actual discharge of the sexual function?
So many and so wonderful are the contrivances
which have slowly been evolved to insure this
discharge, that it is scarcely surprising to find
attention focused upon this one aspect of the
problem. Yet a moment's reflection will show
that so limited a definition of the term "success"
can only be held to apply to certain forms of
life; for where the young have to be cared for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
fostered, and protected from molestation for
periods of varying lengths, the actual discharge
of the sexual function marks but one stage in a
process which can only succeed if all the contributory
factors adequately meet the essential
conditions of the continuance of the species.</p>

<p>Securing a territory is then part of a process
which has for its goal the successful rearing
of offspring. In this process the functioning
of the primary impulse, the acquirement of a
place suitable for breeding purposes, the advent
of a female, the discharge of the sexual function,
the construction of the nest, and the
rearing of offspring follow one another in
orderly sequence. But since we know so little
of the organic changes which determine sexual
behaviour, and have no means of ascertaining
the nature of the impulse which is first
aroused, we can only deal with the situation
from the point at which the internal organic
changes reflect themselves in the behaviour to
a degree which is visible to an external observer.
That point is reached when large numbers of
species, forsaking the normal routine of existence
to which they have been accustomed for
some months, suddenly adopt a radical change
in their mode of behaviour. How is this change
made known to us? By vast numbers of
individuals hurrying from one part of the globe
to another, from one country to another, and
even from mid-ocean to the coasts; by detachments
travelling from one district to another;
by isolated individuals deserting this place for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
that; by all those movements, in fact, which
the term migration, widely applied, is held to
denote. Now the impulse which prompts these
travelling hosts must be similar in kind whether
the journey be long or short; and it were better,
one would think, to regard such movements as
a whole than to fix the attention on some one
particular journey which fills us with amazement
on account of the magnitude of the distance
traversed or the nature of the difficulties overcome.
For, after all, what does each individual
seek? There may be some immature birds which,
though they have not reached the necessary
stage of development, happen to fall in with
others in whom the impulse is strong and are
led by them&mdash;they know not where. But the
majority seek neither continent nor country,
neither district nor locality is their aim, but a
place wherein the rearing of offspring can be
safely accomplished; and the search for this
place is the earliest visible manifestation in many
species of the reawakening of the sexual instinct.</p>

<p>The movements of each individual are then
directed towards a similar goal, namely, the
occupation of a definite station; and this
involves for many species a distinct change in
the routine of behaviour to which previously they
had been accustomed. Observe, for example,
one of the numerous flocks of Finches that
roam about the fields throughout the winter.
Though it may be composed of large numbers
of individuals of different kinds, yet the various
units form an amicable society actuated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
one motive&mdash;the procuring of food. And since
it is to the advantage of all that the individual
should be subordinated to the welfare
of the community as a whole there is no dissension,
apart from an occasional quarrel here
and there.</p>

<p>In response, however, to some internal organic
change, which occurs early in the season,
individuality emerges as a factor in the developing
situation, and one by one the males betake
themselves to secluded positions, where each
one, occupying a limited area, isolates itself from
companions. Thereafter we no longer find that
certain fields are tenanted by flocks of greater
or less dimensions, while acres of land are
uninhabited, but we observe that the hedgerows
and thickets are divided up into so many territories,
each one of which contains its owner.
This procedure, with of course varying detail,
is typical of that of many species that breed in
Western Europe. And since such a radical
departure from the normal routine of behaviour
could scarcely appear generation after generation
in so many widely divergent forms, and still be
so uniform in occurrence each returning season,
if it were not founded upon some congenital
basis, it is probable that the journey, whether it
be the extensive one of the Warbler or the short
one of the Reed-Bunting, is undertaken in
response to some inherited disposition, and
probable also that the disposition bears some
relation to the few acres in which the bird
ultimately finds a resting place. Whilst for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the purpose of the theory I shall give expression
to this behaviour in terms of that
theory, and speak of it as a disposition to
secure a territory, using the word disposition,
which has been rendered current in recent discussion,
for that part of the inherited nature
which has been organised to subserve a specific
biological purpose&mdash;strict compliance with the
rules of psychological analysis requires a simpler
definition; let us therefore say "disposition to
remain in a particular place in a particular
environment."</p>

<p>But even granting that this disposition
forms part of the hereditary equipment of
the bird, how is the process of reproduction
furthered? The mere fact of remaining in or
about a particular spot cannot render the attainment
of reproduction any less arduous, and may
indeed add to the difficulties, for any number
of individuals might congregate together and
mutually affect one another's interests. A
second disposition comes, however, into functional
activity at much the same stage of sexual
development, and manifests itself in the male's
intolerance of other individuals. And the two
combined open up an avenue through which
the individual can approach the goal of reproduction.
In terms of the theory I shall
refer to this second disposition as the one
which is concerned with the defence of the
territory.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, these two dispositions may
be regarded as the basis upon which the breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>ing
territory is founded. Yet inasmuch as the
survival value of the dispositions themselves
must have depended upon the success of the
process as a whole, it is manifest that peculiar
significance must not be attached to just the
area occupied, which happens to be so susceptible
of observation; other contributory factors
must also receive attention, for the process is
but an order of relationships in which the
various units have each had their share in
determining the nature and course of subsequent
process, so that, as Dr Stout says, when they
were modified, it was modified.</p>

<p>Now the male inherits a disposition which
leads it to remain in a restricted area, but the
disposition cannot determine the extent of that
area. How then are the boundaries fixed?
That they are sometimes adhered to with
remarkable precision, that they can only be
encroached upon at the risk of a conflict&mdash;all of
this can be observed with little difficulty. But
if we regard them as so many lines definitely
delimiting an area of which the bird is cognisant,
we place the whole behaviour on a different
level of mental development, and incidentally
alter the complexion of the whole process. It
would be a mistake, I think, to do this. Though
conscious intention as a factor may enter the
situation, there is no necessity for it to do so;
there is no necessity, that is to say, for the bird
to form a mental image of the area to be
occupied and shape its course accordingly. The
same result can be obtained without our having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
recourse to so complex a principle of explanation,
and that by the law of habit formation.
In common with other animals, birds are
subject to this law in a marked degree. An
acquired mode of activity becomes by repetition
ingrained in the life of the individual, so that
an action performed to-day is liable to be
repeated to-morrow so long as it does not prejudice
the existence or annul the fertility of the
individual.</p>

<p>Let us see how this may have operated in
determining the limits of the area acquired, and
for this purpose let us suppose that we are
observing a male Reed-Bunting recently established
in some secluded piece of marsh land.
Scattered about this particular marsh are a
number of small willows and young alder trees,
each one of which is capable of providing plenty
of branches suitable for the bird to perch upon,
and all are in a like favourable position so far as
the outlook therefrom is concerned. Well, we
should expect to find that each respective tree
would be made use of according to the position
in which the bird happened to find itself. But
what actually do we find&mdash;one tree singled out
and resorted to with ever-increasing certainty
until it becomes an important point in relation
to the occupied area, a headquarters from
which the bird advertises its presence by song,
keeps watch upon the movements of its
neighbours, and sets out for the purpose of
securing food. We then take note of its
wanderings in the immediate vicinity of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
headquarters, especially as regards the direction,
frequency, and extent of the journeys; and
we discover not only that these journeys proceed
from and terminate in the special tree,
but that there is a sameness about the actual
path that is followed. The bird takes a short
flight, searches a bush here and some rushes
there, returns, and after a while repeats the
performance; we on our part mark the extreme
limits reached in each direction, and by continued
observation discover that these limits
are seldom exceeded, that definition grows more
and more pronounced, and that by degrees
the movements of the bird are confined within
a restricted area. In outline, this is what
happens in a host of cases. By repetition
certain performances become stereotyped, certain
paths fixed, and a routine is thus established
which becomes increasingly definite as
the season advances.</p>

<p>But while it would be quite untrue to say
that this routine is never departed from, and
equally profitless to attempt to find a point
beyond which the bird will under no circumstances
wander, yet there is enough definition
and more than enough to answer the purpose
for which the territory has, I believe, been
evolved, that is to say the biological end of
reproduction. Again, however, the process of
adjustment is a complex one. Habit plays its
part in determining the boundaries in a rough
and ready manner, but the congenital basis,
which is to be found in the behaviour adapted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to a particular environment, is an important
factor in the situation. For example, if instead
of resting content with just a bare position
sufficient for the purpose of reproduction, the
Guillemot were to hustle its neighbours from
adjoining ledges, the Guillemot as a species
would probably disappear; or if instead of
securing an area capable of supplying sufficient
food both for itself and its young, the Chiffchaff
were to confine itself to a single tree, and,
after the manner of the Guillemot, trust to
spasmodic excursions into neutral ground for
the purpose of obtaining food, the Chiffchaff as
a species would probably not endure. All such
adjustments have, however, been brought about
by relationships which have gradually become
interwoven in the tissue of the race.</p>

<p>The intolerance that the male displays
towards other individuals, usually of the same
sex, leads to a vast amount of strife. Nowhere
in the animal world are conflicts more frequent,
more prolonged, and more determined than in
the sexual life of birds; and though they are
acknowledged to be an important factor in the
life of the individual, yet there is much difference
of opinion as to the exact position they
occupy in the drama of bird life. Partly
because they frequently happen to be in
evidence, partly because they are numerically
inferior, and partly, I suppose, because the
competition thus created would be a means of
maintaining efficiency, the females, by common
consent, are supposed to supply the condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
under which the pugnacious nature of the
male is rendered susceptible to appropriate
stimulation. And so long as the evidence
seemed to show that battles were confined
to the male sex, so long were there grounds
for hoping that their origin might be traced
to such competition. But female fights with
female, pair with pair, and, which is still
more remarkable, a pair will attack a single
male or a single female; moreover, males that
reach their destination in advance of their
prospective mates engage in serious warfare.
How then is it possible to look upon the
individuals of one sex as directly responsible for
the strife amongst those of the other, or how
can the female supply the necessary condition?
As long as an attempt is made to explain it in
terms of the female, the fighting will appear to
be of a confused order; regard it, however, as part
of a larger process which demands, amongst
other essential conditions of the breeding
situation, the occupation of a definite territory,
and order will reign in place of confusion.</p>

<p>But even supposing that the male inherits
a disposition to acquire a suitable area, even
supposing that it inherits a disposition which
results indirectly in the defence of that area,
how does it obtain a mate? If the female
behaved in a like manner, if she, too, were to
isolate herself and remain in one place definitely,
that would only add to the difficulties of mutual
discovery. We find, however, in the migrants,
that the males are earlier than the females<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
in reaching the breeding grounds, and, in
resident species, that they desert the females
and retire alone to their prospective territories,
so that there is a difference in the behaviour
of the sexes at the very commencement of
the sexual process. What is the immediate
consequence? Since the male isolates itself,
it follows, if the union of the sexes is to be
effected, that the discovery of a mate must
rest largely with the female. This of course
reverses the accepted course of procedure.
But after all, what reason is there to suppose
that, the male seeks the female, or that a
mutual search takes place; what reason to
think that this part of the process is subject
to no control except such as may be supplied
by the laws of chance?</p>

<p>Now, clearly, much will depend upon the
rapidity with which the female can discover a
male fit to breed; for if the course of reproduction
is to flow smoothly, there must be neither
undue delay nor waste of energy incurred in the
search&mdash;some guidance is therefore necessary,
some control in her external environment.
Here the song, or the mechanically produced
sound, comes into play, and assists in the attainment
of this end. Nevertheless if every male
were to make use of its powers whether it were
in occupation of a territory or not, if the
wandering individual had an equal chance of
attracting a mate, then it would be idle to
attempt to establish any relation between
"song" on the one hand, and "territory" on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the other, and impossible to regard the voice as
the medium through which an effectual union of
the sexes is procured. But there is reason to
believe that the males utilise their powers of
producing sound only under certain well-defined
conditions. For instance, when they are on
their way to the breeding grounds, or moving
from locality to locality in search of isolation, or
when they desert their territories temporarily,
as certain of the residents often do, they are
generally silent; but when they are in occupation
of their territories they become vociferous&mdash;and
this is notoriously the case during the
early hours of the day, which is the period of
maximum activity so far as sexual behaviour is
concerned. So that just at the moment when
the sexual impulse of the female is most susceptible
to stimulation, the males are betraying
their positions and are thus a guide to her
movements. Nevertheless, even though she
may have discovered a male ready to breed,
success is not necessarily assured to her; for
with multitudes of individuals striving to procreate
their kind, it would be surprising if there
were no clashing of interests, if no two females
were ever to meet in the same occupied territory.
Competition of this kind is not uncommon, and
the final appeal is to the law of battle, just as an
appeal to physical strength sometimes decides
the question of the initial ownership of a
territory.</p>

<p>I shall try to make clear the relations
of the various parts to the whole with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
assistance of whatever facts I can command.
I shall do so not only for the purposes of the
theory, but because one so often finds the
more important features of sexual behaviour
regarded as so many distinct phenomena requiring
separate treatment, whereas they are mutually
dependent, and follow one another in ordered
sequence. I spoke of the process as a series
of relationships. Some of these relationships
have already been touched upon; others will
become apparent if we consider for a moment
the purposes for which the territory has been
evolved. Indirectly its purpose is that of the
whole process, the rearing of offspring. But
inasmuch as a certain measure of success could
be attained, and that perhaps often, without all
the complications introduced by the territory,
there are manifestly advantages to be gained
by its inclusion in the scheme. The difficulties
which beset the path of reproduction are by no
means always the same&mdash;all manner of adjustments
have to be made to suit the needs of
different species. There are direct relationships,
such as we have been speaking of, which are
essential to the every-day working of the
process, and others which are indirect, though
none the less important for they must have
exercised an influence throughout the ages.
These latter are furnished by the physical&mdash;the
inorganic world, by climate, by the supply of
the particular kind of breeding stations, by the
scarcity or abundance of the necessary food
and by the relative position of the food supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to the places suitable for breeding. Why does
the Reed-Bunting cling so tenaciously to an
acre or more of marshy ground, while the
Guillemot rests content with a few square feet
on a particular ledge of rock? The answer is
the same in both cases&mdash;to facilitate reproduction.
But why should a small bird require
so many square yards, whilst a very much
larger one is satisfied with so small an area?
The explanation must be sought in the conditions
of existence. The Reed-Bunting has
no difficulty in finding a position suitable for
the construction of its nest; there are acres
of waste land and reedy swamps capable of
supplying food for large numbers of individuals,
and the necessary situations for countless nests.
But its young, like those of many another
species, are born in a very helpless state. For
all practical purposes they are without covering
of any description and consequently require
protection from the elements, warmth from
the body of the brooding bird, and repeated
supplies of nourishment. A threefold burden
is thus imposed upon the parents: they must
find food for themselves, they must afford
protection to the young by brooding, and they
must supply them with the necessary food at
regular intervals. And their ability to do all
this that is demanded of them will be severely
taxed by the brooding which must perforce
curtail the time available for the collection
of food.</p>

<p>Let us then suppose that the Reed-Buntings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
inhabiting a certain piece of marsh are divided
into two classes, those which are pugnacious
and intolerant of the approach of strangers, and
those which welcome their presence. The nests
of the former will be built in isolation, those
of the latter in close proximity. In due course
eggs will be laid and incubation performed,
and thus far all alike will probably be successful.
Here, however, a critical point is reached. If
the young are to be freed from the risk of
exposure, the parents must find the necessary
supply of food rapidly. But manifestly all
will not be in a like satisfactory position to
accomplish this, for whereas the isolated pairs
will have free access to all the food in the
immediate vicinity of the nest, those which
have built in proximity to one another, meeting
competition in every direction, will be compelled
to roam farther afield and waste much
valuable time by doing so; and under conditions
which can well be imagined, even this slight
loss of time will be sufficient to impede the
growth of the delicate offspring, or to lead
perhaps to still greater disaster. If any one
doubts this, let him first examine one of the
fragile offspring; let him then study the conditions
under which it is reared, observing the
proportion of time it passes in sleep and the
anxiety of the parent bird to brood; and finally
let him picture to himself its plight in a wet
season if, in order to collect the necessary food,
the parents were obliged to absent themselves
for periods of long duration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Now take the case of the Guillemot. Its
young at birth are by no means helpless in the
sense that the young Reed-Bunting is, and food
is readily procured. But breeding stations are
scarce, for although there are many miles of
cliff-bound coast, yet not every type of rock
formation produces the fissures and ledges upon
which the bird rests. Hence vast stretches of
coast-line remain uninhabited, and the birds are
forced to concentrate at certain points, where
year after year they assemble in countless
numbers from distant parts of the ocean. If,
then, different individuals were to jostle one
another from adjoining positions, and each one
were to attempt to occupy a ledge in solitary
State, not only would the successful ones gain
no advantage from the additional space over
which they exercised dominion, but inasmuch as
many members that were fitted to breed would
be precluded from doing so, the status of the
species as a whole would be seriously affected.
The amount of space occupied by each individual
is therefore a matter of urgent importance. A
few square feet of rock sufficient for the immediate
purpose of incubation is all that can be
allowed if the species is to maintain its position
in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>Our difficulty in estimating the importance
of the various factors that make for success or
failure arises from our inability to see more than
a small part of the scene as it slowly unfolds
itself. The peculiar circumstances under which
these cliff-breeding forms dwell does, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
enable us to picture, on the one hand, the
precarious situation of an individual that was
incapable of winning or holding a position at
the accustomed breeding station, and, on the
other, the plight of the species as a whole if
each one exercised authority over too large an
area. With the majority of species it is difficult
to do this. So many square miles of suitable
breeding ground are inhabited by so few Reed-Buntings
that, even supposing certain members
were to establish an ascendency over too wide
an area, it would be impossible to discover
by actual observation whether the race as a
whole were being adversely affected. Competition
doubtless varies at different periods and
in different districts according to the numerical
standing of the species in a given locality and
according to the numerical standing of others
that require similar conditions of existence; at
times it may even be absent, just as at any
moment it may become acute. These examples
show how profoundly the evolution of the
breeding territory may have been influenced by
relationships in the inorganic world, and they
give some idea of the intricate nature of the
problem with which we have to deal.</p>

<p>I mentioned that the first visible manifestation
of the revival of the sexual instinct
was to be found in the movements undertaken
by the males at the commencement
of the breeding season. Such movements are
characterised by a definiteness of purpose,
whether they involve a protracted journey of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
some hundreds of miles or merely embrace a
parish or so in extent, and that purpose is the
acquirement of a territory suitable for rearing
offspring. They are thus directly related to the
territory, and the question arises as to whether
their origin may not be traced to such relatedness.
So long as we fix our attention solely
upon the magnitude of the distance traversed
the suggestion may seem a fanciful one. Nevertheless,
if the battles between males of the
same species <i>are</i> directly related to the occupation
of a position suitable for breeding purposes,
if those which occur between males of closely
related forms <i>can</i> be traced to a similar source,
if the females take their share in the defence
of the ground that is occupied, if, in short, the
competition is as severe as I believe it to be,
and is wholly responsible for the strife which
is prevalent at the commencement of the
breeding season&mdash;then such competition must
have introduced profound modifications in the
distribution of species; it must have even
influenced the question of the survival of
certain forms and the elimination of others;
and since the powers of locomotion of a bird
are so highly developed it must have led to
an extension of breeding range, limited only
by unfavourable conditions of existence.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE DISPOSITION TO SECURE A TERRITORY</h4>


<p>Those who have studied bird life throughout
the year are aware that the distribution of
individuals changes with the changing seasons.
During autumn and winter, food is not so
plentiful and can only be found in certain places,
and so, partly by force of circumstances and
partly on account of the gregarious instinct
which then comes into functional activity,
different individuals are drawn together and
form flocks of greater or less dimensions, which
come and go according to the prevailing climatic
conditions. But with the advent of spring a
change comes over the scene: flocks disperse,
family parties break up, summer migrants begin
to arrive, and the hedgerows and plantations are
suddenly quickened into life. The silence of
the winter is broken by an outburst of song
from the throats of many different species, and
individuals appear in their old haunts and vie
with one another in advertising their presence
by the aid of whatever vocal powers they
happen to possess&mdash;the Woodpecker utters its
monotonous call from the accustomed oak; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Missel-Thrush, perched upon the topmost
branches of the elm, persistently repeats its few
wild notes; and the Swallow returns to the barn.</p>

<p>All of this we observe each season, and our
thoughts probably travel to the delicate piece of
architecture in the undergrowth, or to the hole
excavated with such skill in the tree trunk; to
the beautifully shaped eggs; to the parent birds
carrying out their work with devoted zeal&mdash;in
fact, to the whole series of events which complete
the sexual life of the individual; and the attachment
of a particular bird to a particular spot is
readily accounted for in terms of one or other
of the emotions which centre round the human
home.</p>

<p>But if this behaviour is to be understood
aright; if, that is to say, the exact position it
occupies in the drama of bird life is to be
properly determined, and its biological significance
estimated at its true value, it is above all
things necessary to refrain from appealing to
any one of the emotions which we are accustomed
to associate with ourselves, unless our
ground for doing so is more than ordinarily
secure. I shall try to show that, in the case of
many species, the male inherits a disposition to
secure a territory; or, inasmuch as the word
"secure" carries with it too much prospective
meaning, a disposition to remain in a particular
place when the appropriate time arrives.</p>

<p>If the part which the breeding territory
plays in the sexual life of birds is the important
one I believe it to be, it follows that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
necessary physiological condition must arise at
an early stage in the cycle of events which
follow one another in ordered sequence and
make towards the goal of reproduction, and that
the behaviour to which it leads must be one of
the earliest visible manifestations of the seasonal
development of the sexual instinct. When does
this seasonal development occur? For how
long does the instinct lie dormant? In some
species there is evidence of this first step in the
process of reproduction early in February; there
is reason to believe that in others the latter part
of January is the period of revival; and the
possibility must not be overlooked of still earlier
awakenings, marked with little definiteness,
though nevertheless of sufficient strength to call
into functional activity the primary impulse in
the sexual cycle. Here, then, we meet with a
difficulty so far as direct observation is concerned,
for the duration of the period of
dormancy and the precise date of revival vary
in different species; and, if accurate information
is to be obtained, the study of the series of
events which culminate in the attainment
of reproduction ought certainly to begin the
moment behaviour is influenced by the internal
changes, whatever they may be, which are
responsible for the awakening of the sexual
instinct.</p>

<p>In considering how this difficulty might be
met, the importance of migratory species as a
channel of information was gradually borne in
upon me; for it seemed that the definiteness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
with which the initial stage in the sexual process
was marked off, as a result of the incidence of
migration, would go far towards removing much
of the obscurity which appeared to surround the
earlier stages of the breeding problem in the
case of resident species. Recent observation
has shown that I exaggerated this difficulty, and
that it is generally possible to determine with
reasonable accuracy the approximate date at
which the internal changes begin to exert an
influence on the behaviour of resident species
also. Nevertheless, the specialised behaviour of
the migrants furnished a clue, and pointed out
the direction which further inquiry ought to
take.</p>

<p>Those who are accustomed to notice the
arrival of the migrants are aware that the woods,
thickets, and marshes do not suddenly become
occupied by large numbers of individuals, but
that the process of "filling up" is a gradual
one. An individual appears here, another there;
then after a pause there is a further addition,
and so on with increasing volume until the tide
reaches its maximum, then activity wanes, and
the slowly decreasing number of fresh arrivals
passes unnoticed in the wealth of new life that
everywhere forces itself upon our attention. If
now, instead of surveying the migrants as a
whole, our attention be directed to one species
only, this gradual arrival of single individuals in
their accustomed haunts will become even more
apparent; and if the investigation be pursued
still further and these single individuals observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
more closely, it will be found that in nearly
every case they belong to the male sex. Males
therefore arrive before females. This does not
mean, however, that the respective times of
arrival of the males and females belonging to
any one species are definitely divided, for males
continue to arrive even after some of the females
have reached their destination; and thus a certain
amount of overlapping occurs. A truer
definition of the order of migration would be as
follows:&mdash;Some males arrive before others, and
some females arrive before others, but on the
average males arrive before females. This fact
has long been known. G&auml;tke refers to it in his
<i>Birds of Heligoland</i>. "Here in Heligoland," he
says, "the forerunners of the spring migration
are invariably old males; a week or two later,
solitary old females make their appearance; and
after several weeks, both sexes occur mixed, <i>i.e.</i>,
females and younger males; while finally only
young birds of the previous year are met with."
Newton alludes to it as follows:&mdash;"It has been
ascertained by repeated observation that in the
spring movement of most species of the northern
hemisphere, the cock birds are always in the van
of the advancing army, and that they appear some
days, or perhaps weeks, before the hens"; and
Dr Eagle Clarke, in his <i>Studies in Bird Migration</i>,
makes the following statement:&mdash;"Another
characteristic of the spring is that the males,
the more ardent suitors, of most species, travel
in advance of the females, and arrive at their
meeting quarters some days, it is said in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
cases even weeks, before their consorts." Some
interesting details were given in <i>British Birds</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
in regard to the sex of the migrants that were
killed by striking the lantern at the Tuskar
Rock, Co. Wexford, on the 30th April 1914. In
all, there were twenty-four Whitethroats, nine
Willow-Warblers, eight Sedge-Warblers, and six
Wheatears; and on dissection it was found that
twenty Whitethroats, seven Willow-Warblers,
eight Sedge-Warblers, and one Wheatear were
males.</p>

<p>What a curious departure this seems from
the usual custom in the animal world! Here
we have the spectacle afforded us of the males,
in whom presumably the sexual instinct has
awakened, deserting the females just at the
moment when we might reasonably expect their
impulse to accompany them would be strongest;
and this because of their inherited disposition
to reach the breeding grounds. If, in order
to attain to reproduction, the male depended
primarily upon securing a female&mdash;whether by
winning or fighting matters not at the moment&mdash;if
her possession constituted the sole difference
in his external environment between success and
failure, then surely one would suppose that an
advantage must rest with those individuals
which, instead of rushing forward and inflicting
upon themselves a life of temporary isolation,
remained with the females and increased
their opportunities for developing that mutual
appreciation which, by some, is held to be a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
necessary prelude to the completion of the
sexual act, and to which close companionship
would tend to impart a stimulus.</p>

<p>In thus speaking, however, we assume that
the revival of the sexual instinct in the migratory
male is coincident in time with its return to the
breeding quarters; and we do so because the
act of migrating is believed to be the first step
in the breeding process. But it is well to bear in
mind just how much of this assumption is based
upon fact, and how much is due to questionable
inference. All that can be definitely asserted is
this, that appropriate dissection reveals in most
of the migrants, upon arrival at their destination,
unquestionable evidence of seasonal increase in
the size of the sexual organs. Beyond this there
is nothing to go upon. Yet if the term "sexual
instinct" is held to comprise the whole series of
complex relationships which are manifest to us
in numerous and specialised modes of behaviour,
which ultimately lead to reproduction, and which
have gradually become interwoven in the tissue
of the race, there can be little doubt that the
assumption is a reasonable one. To some, the
term may recall the fierce conflicts which are
characteristic of the season; to others, emotional
response; to not a few, perhaps, the actual
discharge of the sexual function&mdash;all of these, it
is true, are different aspects of the one instinct;
but at the same time each one marks a stage in
the process, and the different stages follow one
another in ordered sequence. However, we are
not concerned at the moment with the term in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
its wider application; we wish to know the
precise stage at which the disposition to mate
influences the behaviour of the male. Is the
female to him, from the moment the seasonal
change in his sexual organs takes place, a goal
that at all costs must be attained? Or is it only
when the cycle of events which leads up to
reproduction is nearing completion that she
looms upon his horizon? One would like to be
in a position to answer these questions, but
there is nothing in the way of experimental
evidence to go upon; and if I say that there is
reason to believe that, in the earlier stages, the
female is but a shadow in the external environment
of the male, it must be taken merely as
an expression of opinion, though based in some
measure upon a general observation of the
behaviour of various species.</p>

<p>Before attempting to explain the difference
in the times of arrival of the male and female
migrant, let us examine the behaviour of some
resident species at a corresponding period.
My investigations have been made principally
amongst the smaller species&mdash;the Finches and
the Buntings&mdash;which often pass the winter in
or near the localities wherein they brought up
offspring or were reared. It is true that they
wander from one field to another according to
the abundance or scarcity of food; it is also true
that, if the weather is of a type which precludes
the possibility of finding the necessary food,
these wanderings may become extensive or even
develop into partial migrations. But under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
normal climatic conditions which prevail in
many parts of Britain, these smaller resident
species seem to find all that they require
without travelling any great distance from
their breeding haunts. Flocks composed of
Yellow Buntings, Cirl Buntings, Corn-Buntings,
Chaffinches, Greenfinches, etc., can be observed
round the farmsteads or upon arable land; small
flocks of Reed-Buntings take up their abode on
pieces of waste land and remain there until the
supply of food is exhausted, deserting their
feeding ground only towards evening when
they retire to the nearest reed-bed to pass the
night; flocks of Hawfinches visit the same holly-trees
day after day so long as there is an
abundance of berries on the ground beneath;
and so on.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the Reed-Bunting; let us
take it as our first example and try to follow its
movements when the influence exerted by the
internal secretions begins to be reflected on the
course of its behaviour. First, it will be
necessary to discover the exact localities in any
given district to which the species habitually
returns for the purpose of procreation; otherwise
the earlier symptoms of any disposition to
secure a territory may quite possibly be overlooked
in the search for its breeding haunts.</p>

<p>In open weather Reed-Buntings pass the
winter either singly, in twos or threes, or in
small flocks, on bare arable ground, upon seed
fields, or in the vicinity of water-courses; but
in the breeding season they resort to marshy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
ground where the <i>Juncus communis</i> grows in
abundance, to the dense masses of the common
reed (<i>Arundo phragmites</i>), and such like places.
During the winter, the male's routine of existence
is of a somewhat monotonous order, limited
to the necessary search for food during the few
short hours of daylight and enforced inactivity
during the longer hours of darkness. But
towards the middle of February a distinct
change manifests itself in the bird's behaviour.
Observe what then happens. When they leave
the reed-bed in the morning, instead of flying
with their companions to the accustomed feeding
grounds, the males isolate themselves and scatter
in different directions. The purpose of their
behaviour is not, however, to find fresh feeding
grounds, nor even to search for food as they
have been wont to do, but rather to discover
stations suitable for the purpose of breeding;
and, having done so, each male behaves in a
like manner&mdash;it selects some willow, alder, or
prominent reed, and, perching thereon, leads
a quiet life, singing or preening its feathers.
Now if the movements of one particular male
are kept in view, it will be noticed that only
part of its time is spent in its territory. At
intervals it disappears. I do not mean that one
merely loses sight of it, but that it actually
deserts its territory. As if seized with a sudden
impulse it rises into the air and flies away, often
for a considerable distance and often in the same
direction, and is absent for a period which may
vary in length from a few minutes to an hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
or even more. But these periodical desertions
become progressively less and less frequent in
occurrence until the whole of its life is spent
in the few acres in which it has established
itself.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the Yellow Bunting is
similar. In any roadside hedge two or more
males can generally be found within a short
distance of one another, and in such a place
their movements can be closely and conveniently
followed. Under normal conditions the ordinary
winter routine continues until early in February;
but the male then deserts the flock, seeks a
position of its own, and becomes isolated from
its companions. Now the position which it
selects does not, as a rule, embrace a very large
area&mdash;a few acres perhaps at the most. But
there is always some one point which is singled
out and resorted to with marked frequency&mdash;a
tree, a bush, a gate-post, a railing, anything in
fact which can form a convenient perch, and
eventually it becomes a central part of the
bird's environment. Here it spends the greater
part of its time, here it utters its song persistently,
and here it keeps watch upon intruders. The
process of establishment is nevertheless a
gradual one. The male does not appear in its
few acres suddenly and remain there permanently
as does the migrant; at first it may not even
roost in the prospective territory. The course
of procedure is somewhat as follows:&mdash;At dawn
it arrives and for a while utters its song, preens
its feathers, or searches for food; then it vanishes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
rising into the air and flying in one fixed
direction as far as the eye can follow, until
it becomes a speck upon the horizon and is
ultimately lost to view. During these excursions
it rejoins the small composite flocks which still
frequent the fields and farm buildings. For a
time the hedgerow is deserted and the bird
remains with its companions. But one does not
have to wait long for the return; it reappears
as suddenly as it vanished, flying straight back
to the few acres which constitute its territory,
back even to the same gate-post or railing,
where it again sings. This simple routine may
be repeated quite a number of times during the
first two hours or so of daylight, with, of course,
a certain amount of variation; on one occasion
the bird may be away for a few minutes only,
on another for perhaps half an hour, whilst
sometimes it will fly for a few hundred yards,
hesitate, and then return&mdash;all of which shows
clearly enough that these few acres possess
some peculiar significance and are capable of
exercising a powerful influence upon the course
of its behaviour. And so the disposition in
relation to the territory becomes dominant in
the life of the bird.</p>

<p>Or take the case of the Chaffinch. In
winter large or small flocks can be found in
many varied situations. But in the latter part
of February, or the early days of March, these
flocks begin to disperse. At daylight males
can then be observed in all kinds of situations,
either calling loudly, uttering their spring note,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
or exercising their vocal powers to the full;
and it will be found that, in the majority of
instances, these males are solitary individuals,
that they pass the early hours of the morning
alone, and that their normal routine of calling,
singing, or searching for food, is only interrupted
by quarrels with their neighbours. The same
locality is visited regularly&mdash;not only the same
acre or so of ground, but even the same elm
or oak, has, as its daily occupant, the same cock
Chaffinch. And temporary desertions from the
territory occur also, much like those referred to
in the life of the Bunting, but perhaps not so
frequently. One has grown so accustomed
during the dark days of winter to the sociable
side of Chaffinch behaviour&mdash;to the large flocks
searching for food, to the endless stream of
individuals returning in the evening to roost
in the holly-trees, to the absence of song&mdash;that
this radical departure from the normal
routine comes as something of a surprise; for
the days are still short, the temperature is still
low, the nesting season is still many weeks
ahead, and yet for part of the day, and for just
that part when the promptings of hunger must
be strongest, the male, instead of joining the
flock, isolates itself and expends a good deal of
energy in insuring that its isolation shall be
complete. And in place of the silence we
hear from all directions the cheerful song
uttered with such marked persistency that it
almost seems as if the bird itself must be
aware that by doing so it was advertising the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
fact of its occupation of a territory. This
is surely a remarkable change, and the females
in the meantime continue their winter routine.</p>

<p>One other example. The monotonous call
of the Greenfinch is probably familiar to all.
In winter these birds accompany other Finches
and form with them flocks of varying sizes, but
in the spring the flocks disperse, and the Greenfinch,
in common with other units of the flock,
alters its mode of life. But whereas the
Chaffinch or the Bunting begins to acquire
its territory in February, the Greenfinch only
does so in April. When the organic changes
do at length begin to make themselves felt,
the male seeks a position of its own, and
having found one remains there, uttering its
characteristic call. But owing probably to the
fact that it is much later than the aforementioned
species in acquiring a territory,
temporary desertions are not so much in evidence.
The species is so very plentiful, and
the bird is so prone to nest in gardens and
shrubberies surrounding human habitations, that
this seasonal change in its routine of existence
cannot fail to be noticed. One can hear its
call in every direction, one can watch the
same individual in the same tree; and it is
the male that is thus seen and heard, the
female appears later. Thus the behaviour falls
into line with that of the Bunting or the
Chaffinch.</p>

<p>The behaviour of these resident species
throws some light upon the early arrival of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
males which we are endeavouring to explain in
the case of the migrants. Let us see how their
actions compare. The male resident deserts the
female early in the year and establishes itself in
a definite position, where it advertises its presence
by song; the male migrant travels from a great
distance, arrives later, and also establishes itself
in a definite position, where it, too, advertises its
presence by song. The male resident passes
only the earlier part of the day in its territory at
the commencement of the period of occupation;
the male migrant remains there continuously
from the moment it arrives. The male resident
deserts its territory at intervals, even in the
morning; the male migrant betrays no inclination
to do so. Thus there is a very close
correspondence between the behaviour of the
two, and what difference there is&mdash;slight after
all&mdash;cannot be said to affect the main biological
end of securing territory. One is apt to think
of the problem of migration in terms of the
species instead of in terms of the individual.
One pictures a vast army of birds travelling
each spring over many miles of sea and land,
and finally establishing themselves in different
quarters of the globe; and so it comes about,
I suppose, that a country or some well-defined
but extensive area is regarded as the destination,
the ultimate goal, of the wanderers. But the
resident male has a journey to perform, short
though it may be; it, too, has a destination
to reach, neither a country nor a locality, but
a place wherein the rearing of offspring can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
be safely accomplished, and it, too, arrives in
that place in advance of the female.</p>

<p>With these facts at our disposal, we will
endeavour to find an explanation. It is unlikely
that specialised behaviour would occur in generation
after generation under such widely divergent
conditions, and, moreover, expose the birds to
risk of special dangers, if it were but an
hereditary peculiarity to which no meaning
could be attached. Hence the appearance of
the males in their breeding haunts ahead of the
females becomes a fact of some importance, and
suggests that the extensive journey in the one
case, and the short journey in the other, may
both have a similar biological end to serve.</p>

<p>Darwin evidently attached importance to
this difference between the males and the
females in their times of arrival. In the
<i>Descent of Man</i> he referred to it as follows:
"Those males which annually first migrated in
any country, or which in spring were first ready
to breed, or were the most eager, would leave
the largest number of offspring; and these
would tend to inherit similar instincts and
constitutions. It must be borne in mind that
it would have been impossible to change very
materially the time of sexual maturity in the
females without at the same time interfering
with the period of the production of the young&mdash;a
period which must be determined by the
season of the year." Newton suggested the
following explanation<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>: "It is not difficult to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
imagine that, in the course of a journey prolonged
through some 50&deg; or 60&deg; of latitude,
the stronger individuals should outstrip the
weaker by a very perceptible distance, and it
can hardly be doubted that in most species
the males are stouter, as they are bigger
than the females." Granting that the males
are the stronger, how can this account for their
outstripping the females by a week, ten days,
or even a fortnight, in a journey of perhaps
1500 miles? To expect the birds to accomplish
such a distance in seven days is surely
not estimating their capabilities too highly,
and any slight inequality in the power of
flight or endurance could give the males an
advantage of a few hours only. But this explanation,
based upon inequalities in the power
of flight and endurance on the one hand, and
the magnitude of the distance traversed on the
other, cannot afford a solution of the behaviour
of the resident males, and is less likely, therefore,
to be a true solution of that of the
migrants.</p>

<p>There is another theory, simple enough in its
way, which will probably occur to many. It is
based on the assumption that the males reach
sexual maturity before the females; and it is
contended that the functioning of the instincts
which contribute towards the biological end of
reproduction depend upon the organic changes
which the term "sexual maturity" is held to
embrace, and that, inasmuch as the migratory
instinct belongs to the group of such instincts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the males must be the first to leave their winter
quarters.</p>

<p>What is meant by the "migratory instinct"?
To speak of it as one of the instincts concerned
in reproduction is not enough. Reproduction
involves the actual discharge of the sexual
function, which involves the females; but the
first visible manifestation of organic change in
the male is its desertion of the females. Yet
this is the behaviour which is referred to as the
"migratory instinct," and which comes into play,
according to this theory, because the bird has
reached sexual maturity. Manifestly we must
have some clear understanding as to what these
terms represent. That organic changes determine
the functioning of certain definite instincts
at certain specified times there can be no doubt;
that these changes may occur at a somewhat
earlier date in the male than in the female is
more than probable, but that this explains the
behaviour in question I do not believe. One
wants to know why the changes should occur
earlier in the male, what disposition it is which
first comes into functional activity, and to what
such disposition is related.</p>

<p>It may, however, be urged that, after all,
this apparent eagerness to reach the breeding
grounds is but a modification of hereditary procedure
under the guiding hand of experience.
What more likely result would follow from the
enjoyment associated with previous success in
the attainment of reproduction than a craving to
repeat the experience? What stronger incentive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
to a hurried return could be imagined? It must
be admitted that there are certain facts which
might be used in support of an appeal to
experience as a reasonable explanation. For
example, the first males to arrive often display
that richness of colouring which is generally
supposed to indicate a fuller maturity. G&auml;tke
even speaks of the "most handsome old birds
being invariably the first to hasten back to their
old homes." But if experience is a factor, if
some dim recollection of the past is held to
explain the hurried departure of the male
migrant, one wants to know with what such
recollection is associated. Is it associated with
the former female, or with the former breeding
place, or with both? I take it that any recollection,
no matter how vague, must be primarily
associated with the particular place wherein
reproduction had previously been accomplished;
and I grant that if the first individuals to
appear were invariably the older and experienced
birds, their early return might be explained on
the basis of such an association. But if there
is reason to believe that a proportion are young
birds on the verge of carrying out their instinctive
routine for the first time, then we cannot
appeal to past experience in explanation of their
behaviour.</p>

<p>The age of a bird is difficult to determine.
Experience leads me to believe that some of
the males that arrive before the females are
birds born the previous season; one finds, for
instance, individuals with plumage of a duller hue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
which denotes immaturity, amongst the first
batch of arrivals. But though plumage may
sometimes be a satisfactory guide, yet to rely
upon it alone, or upon a more perfect development
of feather, is to exceed the limits of
safety. How, then, can we ascertain whether
all the males that arrive before the females have
had some previous experience of reproduction?
Well, we take a particular locality and note the
migrants that visit it year after year, and we
find that the respective numbers of the different
species are subject to wide annual fluctuations.
Not every species lends itself to an inquiry of
this kind: some are always plentiful and fluctuation
is consequently difficult to discern; others
are scarce and variation is easily determined.
Those which are of local distribution but conspicuous
by their plumage, or easily traced by
the beauty or the peculiarity of their song,
afford the more suitable subjects for investigation.
For example, the Grasshopper-Warbler,
Marsh-Warbler, Nightingale, Corncrake, Red-backed
Shrike, or Whinchat have each some
distinctive peculiarity which makes them conspicuous,
and each one is subject to marked
fluctuation in numbers. The small plantation or
wooded bank may hold a Nightingale one year,
but we miss its song there the next; the
osier bed or gorse-covered common which vibrates
with the trill of the Grasshopper-Warbler one
April is deserted the following season; the
plantation which is occupied by a host of
common migrants this summer may be enlivened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
next year by the song of the rarer Marsh-Warbler
also; and so on. The fluctuation is
considerable: we observe desertion on the one
hand, appropriation on the other, and yet males
appear before females whether the particular
plantation, osier bed, or swamp had been inhabited
or not the previous season. This fact is
not without significance. It shows that similar
conditions prevail both amongst the males that
appropriate breeding grounds new to them, and
amongst those that return to some well-established
haunt; and on the assumption that
the earlier arrivals are experienced males, the
same birds evidently do not return to the same
place year after year. Granting, then, that the
males which appropriate new breeding-grounds
are young birds, how can their earlier arrival
be explained in terms of past experience; and
granting that they are old, and therefore
experienced, how can it be explained in terms of
association?</p>

<p>Again, it may be urged that if there is some
biological end to be furthered by this hurried
return, and if recollection of past experience is a
means towards that end, such recollection need
not necessarily be associated with a definite
place, but only in a vague way with the whole
series of events leading up to reproduction&mdash;in
which series the migratory journey may even
have acquired meaning. Whether there be any
recollection of a previous journey or of a nest
with young, I do not know. But the young
bird is capable of performing its journey, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
building its nest, and of rearing its young antecedent
to experience&mdash;racial preparation has
fitted it thus far; why then exclude the other
event in the series, the earlier departure of the
male, from hereditary equipment? If the
journey were a casual affair without any goal
attaching to it, if the males upon arrival
wandered about in search of a mate, there would
be some ground for thinking that a vague
recollection of the whole former experience was
sufficient to explain the hurried return; but
since the pleasurable effect of association,
founded upon previous experience of a definite
place, cannot well be established, and since it is
so difficult to study the objective aspect of the
behaviour in question without coming to the
conclusion that the journey is related to the
appropriation of a place suitable for the rearing
of offspring, one is tempted to ask whether the
hurried return may not also be so related.</p>

<p>Now the males of some of the migratory
species, especially of those which are accustomed
to return to their breeding haunts early
in the season, are called upon to face greater
dangers and have a greater strain imposed
upon their strength by starting forth upon their
journey ten days or a fortnight before their
prospective mates. The blizzards which so often
sweep across the northern parts of Europe in
the latter half of March, destroying in their
course the all too scanty supply of insect life,
may take toll of their numbers; or the westerly
gales, which are not infrequent at that period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
may meet them in mid-ocean and add to the
perils of their journey; or the temperature of
the previous weeks may have been sufficiently
low to arrest the development of insect life&mdash;and
yet males are annually exposed to these
risks in hurrying to their breeding grounds.
For what purpose? The answer will largely
depend upon the way in which we regard those
few acres wherein a resting place is ultimately
found. For myself, I believe that they are
of importance, inasmuch as the securing of a
place suitable for the rearing of offspring is
a primary condition of success in the attainment
of reproduction; and if this be so, it is
evident that the interests of the race will be
better served by the males making good this
first step before the females are ready to pair,
otherwise they might oscillate between two
modes of behaviour, created by the premature
functioning of conflicting impulses.</p>

<p>The different steps in the process seem to
follow one another in ordered sequence. The
male inherits a disposition&mdash;which for us, of
course, has prospective meaning&mdash;to seek the
appropriate breeding ground and there to
establish itself; and as early a functioning of
this disposition as possible, consonant with the
conditions of existence in the external environment,
may have been evolved for the following
reasons&mdash;firstly, the earlier individuals will
meet with less interference wherever they may
settle, every locality will be open to them,
every acre free, their only need being that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
particular environment for which racial preparation
has fitted them. In the second place,
being already established when other males
appear upon the scene, and advertising their
presence by song, they will be less liable to
molestation; thirdly, in those cases in which
a long journey is undertaken, they will have
ample time to recover from the fatigue, and,
if attacked by later arrivals, will thus be in a
better position to defend their territories; and
lastly, a greater uniformity in their distribution
will be insured before the females begin their
search.</p>

<p>There is, besides, another good reason for
thinking that the earlier males will have an
advantage. We will assume&mdash;and from the
abundant evidence supplied by the marking
of birds, it is quite a reasonable assumption&mdash;that
there is a tendency, generally speaking,
for individuals to return to the neighbourhood
of their birthplace, or to the place in which
they had previously reared their offspring.
Now the earlier arrivals will have no difficulty
in securing territories; those that come later
may have to search more diligently, still they
will gain all that they require so long as any
available space remains. Then comes the point
when all suitable ground is occupied, and yet
there are males to be provided for. What
will be the position of these males? Urged by
their inherited nature, they will leave the district
and possibly continue their search into those
adjoining, only, however, to add to the diffi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>culties
of the males there similarly situated;
and even allowing that they are at length
successful in establishing themselves, what
are their prospects of securing mates? Since
the earlier females will not extend their wanderings
farther than is absolutely necessary, but
will pair whenever the opportunity for doing
so arises, it is to the later females, forced
onwards by competition, that the late males
must look for mates; so that when at length
pairing does take place, much valuable time
will have been lost.</p>

<p class="tb">The disadvantages which the late arrivals
have to face are therefore great, and it is
probable that the percentage which attain to
reproduction will on the average be somewhat
lower than the percentage in the case of the
earlier arrivals. The district in which my
observations have been made lies well within
the limits of the breeding range of most of
our common species, and it is not surprising
that I should have met with little evidence
of failure to breed as a result of failure to
secure territory. Some interesting information
was supplied to me, however, by the late
Robert Service. He found, in certain seasons
in Dumfriesshire, flocks of from ten to fifty
unmated Sedge-Warblers, which, from the time
of their arrival in May until the middle of
July, haunted reed-filled spaces along stagnant
streams. These flocks appeared to him to be
composed of loosely-attached individuals of
a migrant flock that had failed to find things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
congenial enough to entice them to disperse.
But may they not have been composed of
males that had failed to secure territories, or
of females that had failed to discover males in
possession of territories, or of both?</p>

<p>We have seen that, in the case of many
species, each male establishes itself in a
particular place at the commencement of the
breeding season, even though this may mean a
partial or perhaps a complete severance from
former companions. We must now discuss
this fact in greater detail because it is opposed
to the views often held regarding the sexual
behaviour of birds, and is manifestly of importance
when considering the theory of breeding
territory.</p>

<p>First, however, there is a point which
requires some explanation. I speak of the <i>same</i>
male being in the <i>same</i> place. How can I prove
its identity? In the first place it is highly
improbable that a bird which roams about
within the same small area of ground, makes
regular use of a certain tree and a certain
branch of that tree, and observes a similar
routine day after day, can be other than the
same individual. But, apart from this general
consideration, are there any means by which
individuals of the same species can be identified?
Well, there is variation in the plumage.
Supposing we take a dozen cock Chaffinches
and examine them carefully, we shall find slight
differences in pattern and in colour&mdash;more grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
here or a duller red there, as the case may be&mdash;and
though these differences may not be
sufficient to enable us to pick out a bird at
a distance, they are nevertheless conspicuous
when it is close at hand. Then again there is
variation in the song; and the more highly
developed the vocal powers the greater scope
there is for variation. But even the phrases of
a simple song can be split up and recombined
in different ways. If one were asked casually
whether the different phrases of the Reed-Bunting's
song always followed one another in
the same sequence, the answer would probably
be that they certainly did so, whereas the bird is
capable of combining the few notes it possesses
in a surprising number of different ways. And
lastly, there are differences in just the particular
way in which specific behaviour, founded upon
a congenital basis, is adapted by each individual
to its own special environment. Racial preparation
determines behaviour as a whole, but
the individual is allowed some latitude in the
execution of details which are in themselves of
small moment&mdash;the selection of a particular tree
as a headquarters and a particular branch upon
that tree, the direction of the distant excursion,
and the direction of the limited wanderings
within the small area surrounding the headquarters
which in the course of time determine
the extent of the territory, are matters for
each individual to decide when the occasion
for doing so arises. Moreover instances of
abnormal coloration or abnormal song are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
rare, and they are valuable since they place
the identity of the individual beyond dispute.
I can recall the case of a Willow-Warbler whose
song was unlike that of its own or any other
species, and of a Redbreast whose voice puzzled
me not a little. I can recollect also a male Yellow
Bunting whose foot was injured or deformed.
Of this bird's behaviour I kept a record for two
months or so; and inasmuch as it inhabited a
roadside hedge, and was of fearless disposition,
the deformed foot could plainly be seen whenever
it settled upon the road to search for food.
Identification is not, therefore, a difficulty.
There is always some small difference in colour
or in song, or some well-defined routine which
makes recognition possible.</p>

<p>Owing to their great powers of locomotion,
birds have generally been regarded as wanderers
more or less; anything in the nature of a fixed
abode, apart from the actual nest, having been
accounted foreign to their mode of life; and
even the locality immediately surrounding the
nest has not been apprehended as possessing any
meaning for the owner of that nest. No doubt
the supply of food determines their movements
for a considerable part of the year; they seek
it where they can find it, here to-day, there
to-morrow&mdash;in fact few species fail to move
their quarters at one season or another, so that
there is much truth in the notion that birds
are wanderers. Yet to suppose that every
individual one sees or hears&mdash;every Lapwing
on the meadow, or Nightingale in the withy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
bed&mdash;is in that particular spot just because it
happens to alight there as it roams from place to
place, is to take a view which the observed facts
do not support. For as soon as the question
of reproduction dominates the situation, a new
condition arises, and the habits formed during
the previous months are reversed, and the males,
avoiding one another, or even becoming actively
hostile, prefer a life of seclusion to their former
gregariousness&mdash;all of which occurs just at the
moment when we might reasonably expect them
to exhibit an increased liveliness and restlessness
as a result of their endeavour to secure mates;
and so universal is the change that it might
almost be described as an accompaniment of the
sexual life of birds generally.</p>

<p>That the Raven and certain birds of prey
exert an influence over the particular area which
they inhabit has long been known, and it has
been recognised more especially in the case of
the Peregrine Falcon, possibly because the bird
lives in a wild and attractive country, and,
forcing itself under the notice of naturalists, has
thus had a larger share of attention devoted to its
habits. Moreover, when a species is represented
by comparatively few individuals, and each pair
occupies a comparatively large tract of country,
it is a simple matter to trace the movements
and analyse the behaviour of the birds. There
is a rocky headland in the north-west of
Co. Donegal comprising some seven miles or
so of cliffs, where three pairs of Falcons and two
pairs of Ravens have nested for many years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Each year the different pairs have been more
or less successful in rearing their young; each
year the young can be seen accompanying their
parents up to the time when the sexual instinct
arises; and yet the actual number of pairs is on
the whole remarkably constant, and there is no
perceptible increase. It seems as if the numbers
of three and two respectively were the maximum
the headland could maintain. But this
is no exceptional case; it represents fairly the
conditions which obtain as a rule amongst
those species, granting, of course, a certain
amount of variation in the size of each territory
determined by the exigencies of diverse
circumstances.</p>

<p>If we take a given district, and devote our
attention to the smaller migrants that visit
Western Europe each returning spring for the
purpose of procreation, we shall find that the
movements of the males are subject to a very
definite routine. This, however, is not true of
every male; some may be wending their way to
breeding grounds at a distance; others may be
seeking the particular environment to which
they may be adapted; others again, having found
their old haunts destroyed, may consequently
be seeking new.</p>

<p>Of all this there is evidence. Small parties
of Chiffchaffs pass through a district on their
way to other breeding grounds, flitting from
hedge to hedge as they move in a definite
direction with apparently a definite purpose;
Reed-Warblers settle in a garden or plantation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
eminently unsuited to their requirements, and
disappear; Wood-Warblers arrive in some old
haunt, and finding it no longer suitable for
their purpose, seek new ground. So that plenty
of individuals are always to be found, which, for
the time being at least, are wanderers.</p>

<p>In the district which I have in mind, the
wandering males form only a small part of the
incoming bird population. The majority of
individuals that fall under observation are those
that have made this particular district their
destination; and in doing so, they may possibly
have been guided by their experience as owners
or inmates of former nests, for it cannot be
doubted that a return to the neighbourhood of
the birthplace would lead to a more uniform
distribution and therefore be advantageous, and
the tendency to do so might consequently have
become interwoven in the tissue of the race.
How, then, do they behave? A certain amount
of movement, an interchanging of positions, even
though restricted to an area defined, let us say,
by experience, might be expected under the
circumstances&mdash;that, however, is not what we
find; we observe the available situations plotted
out into so many territories, each one of which
is occupied by a male who passes the whole of
his time therein. Take whatever species we
will&mdash;Whitethroat, Whinchat, Willow-Warbler,
Red-backed Shrike, it matters not which, for
there is no essential difference in the general
course of procedure&mdash;this condition will be
found to prevail. Generally speaking, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
behaviour in relation to the territory can be
studied more conveniently where a number of
individuals of the same species have established
themselves in proximity to one another. Such
species as the Chiffchaff, Willow-Warbler, or
Wood-Warbler are often sufficiently common to
allow of three or more of their respective males
being kept in view at the same time; and the
disposition to occupy a definite position can be
readily observed. The Reed-Warbler is a suitable
subject for an investigation of this kind;
for since it is restricted by its habits to localities
wherein the common reed (<i>Arundo phragmites</i>)
grows in abundance, and since such localities
are none too plentiful and often limited in
extent, the area occupied by each individual is
necessarily small&mdash;if it were not so the species
would become extinct. Hence it is a simple
matter to study the routine of the different
individuals and to mark the extent of their
wanderings.</p>

<p>In this way the males of all the Warblers
that breed commonly in Great Britain establish
themselves, each one in its respective station at
the respective breeding ground; so, too, do
those of many other migrants&mdash;for example, the
Whinchat, Wheatear, Tree-Pipit, and Red-backed
Shrike. All of these, it is true, are
common species&mdash;numbers of individuals can
often be found in close proximity&mdash;and therefore
it may be argued that they keep to one position
more from pressure of population than from any
inherited disposition working towards that end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
But the rarer species behave similarly. Districts
frequented by the Marsh-Warbler and offering
plenty of situations of the type required by the
bird are often inhabited by a few members only,
and yet the disposition to remain in a definite
position is just as marked.</p>

<p>You will say, however, that these smaller
migrants have no exceptional powers of flight;
that they have besides just completed a long
and arduous journey; and you will ask why
they should be expected to wander, whether it
is not more reasonable to expect that, in order
to overcome their fatigue, they should remain
where they settle. The Cuckoo is a wanderer
in the wider sense of the term, and is gifted with
considerable powers of flight. Upon arrival the
male flies briskly from field to field, showing but
little signs of weariness; yet we have only to
follow its movements for a few days in succession
to assure ourselves that the bird is no longer
a wanderer; for just as the Warbler or the Chat
moves only within a definitely delimited area,
so the male Cuckoo, strange as it may seem,
restricts itself to a particular tract of land.
The area over which it wanders is often considerable
and consequently it is not possible to
keep the bird always in view, but inasmuch
as the variation in the voices of different
individuals is quite appreciable, identification is
really a simple matter. If we cannot keep the
bird in sight, we can trace its movements by
sound and mark the extent of its wanderings,
which by repetition become more and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
defined, until a belt of trees here, or an orchard
there, mark a rough and rarely passed boundary
line.</p>

<p>Let us take another example from the larger
migrants&mdash;the Black-tailed Godwit, a bird
common enough in the Dutch marshes but no
longer breeding in this country. On suitable
stretches of marsh land, numbers will be found
in proximity one to another after the manner
of the Lapwing, each male occupying a definite
space of ground wherein it passes the time
preening, searching for food, or in sleep&mdash;though
at the same time keeping a strict watch
over its territory. Now the preference shown
for a particular piece of ground, and the determination
with which it is resorted to, is the
more remarkable when we take into consideration
the specific emotional behaviour arising
from the seasonal sexual condition. This
behaviour is expressed in a peculiar flight. The
bird rises high in the air, circles round with
slowly beating wings above the marsh, and
utters a call which, as far as my experience goes,
is characteristic of the performance. The air
is often full of individuals circling thus even
beyond the confines of the marsh, for a male
does not limit its flight to a space immediately
above its territory; but nevertheless careful
observation will show how unerringly each one
returns to its own position on the breeding
ground, no matter how extensive the aerial
excursion may have been. And so, when the
males of the smaller migrants confine their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
movements to an acre of ground at the completion
of their long journey, they are acting no
more under the influence of fatigue than the
Cuckoo, which keeps within certain bounds yet
flies about briskly, or the Godwit which, though
holding to its few square yards on the ground,
executes most tiring and extensive flights above
the marsh.</p>

<p>Of all the migrants, however, the behaviour
of the Ruff is perhaps the most strange, and
though it has long been known that these birds
have their special meeting places where they
perform antics and engage in serious strife, yet
it is only within recent years that the primary
purpose of these gatherings has been ascertained&mdash;that
purpose being the actual discharge of
the sexual function. Mr. Edmund Selous has
carried out some exhaustive investigations into
their activities at the meeting places, and he
makes it clear that each bird has its allotted
position. He says, for example, that "It begins
to look as though different birds had little
seraglios of their own in different parts of the
ground," that "each Ruff has certainly a place
of its own," or again that "this Ruff indeed,
which I think must be a tender-foot, does not
seem to have a place of its own like the others."
Nevertheless it is only at the meeting places
that they have their special positions; there is
no evidence to show that each one has a special
territory, wherein it seeks its food, as the
Warbler has, and therefore some may think that
we are here confronted with behaviour of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
different order. But we must bear in mind that
the process has been adjusted to meet the
requirements of different species: the size of the
territory, the period of its daily occupation, the
purpose which it serves&mdash;these all depend upon
manifold relationships and do not affect the
principle. Why it has been differentiated in
different circumstances we shall have occasion
to discuss later; for the moment it is enough
that at the end of its migratory journey each
Ruff occupies one position on the meeting
ground.</p>

alt="Territorial flight of the Black-tailed Godwit." title="Territorial flight of the Black-tailed Godwit." /></div>

<p>Now birds that are paired for life, whose
food-supply is not affected by alternations of
climate, have no occasion to desert the locality
wherein they have reared their offspring, and so
their movements, being subject to a routine
which would tend to become increasingly
definite, must in the course of time and according
to the law of habit formation become
organised into the behaviour we observe. Is it
necessary, therefore, to seek an explanation of
their tendency to remain in one place in anything
so complex as an inherited disposition?
Again, since we have to confess to so very much
ignorance on so many points connected with the
whole phenomenon of migration, may there not
be some condition, hitherto shrouded in mystery,
which might place so different a complexion on
the corresponding aspect of migrant behaviour
as to rid us, in their case also, of the necessity
of appealing to an inherited disposition? Such
questions are justifiable. And if the life-histories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of other species gave no further support
to our interpretation, if, in short, the evidence
were to break down at this point, then we
should be forced to seek some other explanation
more in keeping with the general body of
facts.</p>

<p>But far from placing any obstacle in the way
of an interpretation in terms of inherited disposition,
the behaviour of many of those residents
which are not paired for life gives us even surer
ground for that belief. Moreover in their case
the initial stages in the process are more accessible
to observation. I will endeavour to explain
why. In the process of reproduction the
environment has its part to play&mdash;whether in the
manner here suggested, or indirectly through
the question of food-supply, matters not at the
moment. Now, migratory species are more
highly specialised than resident species as
regards food, and are affected more by variations
of temperature, so that they can live for only a
part of the year in the countries which they visit
for the purpose of procreation. Hence the
organic changes, which set the whole process in
motion, must be coincident in time with the
growth of appropriate conditions in the environment;
for if it were not so, if the internal
organic changes were to develop prematurely,
the bird would undertake its journey only to
find an insufficiency of food upon its arrival, and
this would scarcely contribute towards survival.
Definite limitations have therefore been imposed
upon the period of organic change. But in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
case of many resident species the conditions are
somewhat different, for they remain in the same
locality throughout the year, and a gradual
unfolding of the reproductive process cannot
therefore have a similarly harmful effect. Thus
it comes about that the behaviour of the
migrant, when it arrives at the breeding ground
and first falls under observation, represents a
stage in the process which, in the case of the
resident, is only reached by slow degrees; and
by closely observing the behaviour as it is
presented to us in the life of the resident male,
we not only gain a better insight into the
changes in operation, but can actually witness
the breaking down of the winter routine, stereotyped
through repetition, by the new disposition
as it arises.</p>

<p>The first visible manifestations, even though
they may be characterised by a certain amount
of vagueness, are therefore of great importance
if the behaviour is to be interpreted aright; and
in order to insure that none of these earlier
symptoms shall be missed, it is necessary to
begin the daily record of the bird's movements
at an early date in the season. As a rule the
second week in February is sufficiently early for
the purpose, but the date varies according to the
prevailing climatic conditions. Even in species
widely remote there is great similarity of procedure,
and the behaviour of the Buntings is
typical of that of many. With the rise of the
appropriate organic state the male resorts at
daybreak to a suitable environment, occupies a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
definite position, and singling out some tree or
prominent bush, which will serve as a headquarters,
advertises its presence there by song.
At first the bird restricts its visits, which though
frequent in occurrence are of short duration, for
the most part to the early hours of the morning;
it disappears as suddenly as it appeared, and
one can trace its flight to the feeding grounds&mdash;a
homestead or perhaps some newly sown
field. But by degrees the impulse to seek the
society of the flock grows less and less pronounced,
the visits to the territory are more
and more prolonged, and the occupation of
it then becomes the outstanding feature of
the bird's existence. This in outline is the
course of procedure as it appears to an external
observer.</p>

<p>But although much can be learnt from the
lives of these smaller species, there is no gain-saying
the fact that a great deal of patient
observation is required, and the process is apt
to become tedious. There are others, however,
which are more readily observed, whilst their
life-histories afford just as clear an insight into
the effect produced by the new disposition
upon the developing situation; and among these
the Lapwing takes a prominent position, because
it is plentiful and inhabits open ground where
it is easily kept in view.</p>

<p>There is a water meadow with which I am
familiar, where large numbers resort annually
for the purpose of procreation. Here they
begin to arrive towards the end of February,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
and at first collect in a small flock at one end
of the meadow. A male, here and there, can
then be seen to break away from the flock, and
to establish itself in a definite position upon the
unoccupied portion of the ground, where it
remains isolated from its companions. Others
do likewise until the greater part of the meadow
is divided into territories. Six of these territories
I kept under observation for approximately
two months in the year 1915. The occupant
of the one marked No. 6 upon the 1915 plan
was a lame bird, a fortunate occurrence as it
enabled me to follow its movements with some
accuracy; and though it maintained its position
for some weeks, it ultimately disappeared, as a
result, I believe, of the persistent attacks of
neighbouring males. The behaviour of the
males during the first fortnight or so after
they broke away from the flock was interesting.
Though they retired to their territories and
remained in them for the greater part of their
time, yet it was only by degrees that they
finally severed their connection with the flock,
for so long as a nucleus of a flock remained,
so long were they liable to desert their
territories temporarily and to rejoin their
companions.</p>

<p>Lapwings, as is well known, collect in flocks
during the winter months, and these flocks,
which sometimes reach vast proportions, are
to be found on tidal estuaries, water meadows,
arable land, and such like places, according to
the prevailing climatic conditions. This flocking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
may contribute towards survival, and may
therefore be the result of congenital dispositions
which have been determined on biological
grounds. On the other hand, since food at
that season is only to be obtained in a limited
number of situations, the birds may be simply
drawn together by accident. In the former
case the behaviour would be instinctive, in
the latter, though accidental at first, recurrent
repetition would tend to make it habitual; but
in either case the impulse to accompany the
flock must be a powerful one, for on the one
hand it would depend upon inherited, and on
the other hand upon acquired, connections in
the nervous system. Now observe that soon
after the flock arrived in the meadow, single
males detached themselves; there was no
hesitation, they just retired from their companions
and settled in their respective territories.
They were not expelled, for if their leaving had
been compulsory much commotion would have
preceded their departure, and their return
would certainly not have been welcomed. A
reference to the plan will make the position
clearer; the neutral zone inhabited by the
flock is there shown as situated in one corner
of the meadow, the territories that fell under
observation are plotted out as far as possible
to scale, and the more important zones of
conflict are also marked.</p>

<p>The males spent part of their time in their
respective territories and part with the flock,
so long as it remained in existence. When a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
male was in its territory it avoided companions
and was openly hostile to intruders; when it
was with the flock it wandered about with
companions in search of food. The contrast
between the two modes of behaviour was very
marked, and it was evident that the gregarious
instinct was gradually yielding its position of
importance to the new factor&mdash;the territory.
If there had been no flock, if a few solitary
individuals had appeared here and there and
had established themselves in different parts of
the meadow, one would have had no definite
evidence of the strength of the impulse in the
male to seek a position of its own, one could
only have argued from the general fact of males
flocking in the winter and isolating themselves
in spring that something more than accident
was required to explain so radical a change.
But since the birds returned in a flock to the
ground upon which they intended to breed, and
since the flock occupied temporarily part of
the ground whilst the partitioning of the
remainder was still proceeding, it was possible
to gauge the strength of the impulse, which was
forcing the males to isolate themselves in
particular areas of ground, by comparing it
with the impulse to accompany the flock&mdash;and
the measure of its intensity was the rapidity
with which the latter impulse yielded its position
of importance.</p>

<p>Like the Lapwing, the Coot and Moor-Hen
are easily kept under observation, and since
many individuals often breed in proximity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
more than one can be watched at the same
moment; moreover the area occupied by each
male generally embraces an open piece of
water as well as part of the fringe of reeds,
so that the movements of the bird can be
followed without much difficulty. Under favourable
conditions manifestations of the developing
situation become visible at a comparatively
early date in the season&mdash;the middle or the
latter part of February&mdash;and these manifestations
resemble those of other species. But
the Moor-Hen passes summer and winter alike
in the same situation, and being therefore in
a position to respond at once to internal stimulation,
however vague, the change from the one
state to the other is gradual. This, however,
is a matter of detail; the main consideration
lies in the fact that the impulse to retire to
a definite position, to avoid companions, and
to live in seclusion, is strongly marked, and
produces a type of behaviour similar on the
whole to that of the Lapwing. First of all
there is the appropriation of a certain position,
the limits of which are fixed according to the
law of habit formation, and according to the
pressure exerted by neighbouring individuals;
then there is the neutral ground over which
the birds wander amicably in search of food;
and finally there is the contrast between the
pugnacity of the male whilst in its territory,
and its comparative friendliness when upon
neutral ground.</p>

<p>Evidence of similar behaviour is to be found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
in the life of the Black Grouse, a bird which has
always excited the curiosity of naturalists on
account of the special meeting places to which
both sexes resort in the spring. Mr. Edmund
Selous watched these birds in Scandinavia,
where he kept a daily record at one of the
meeting places. In various passages he refers
to the appropriation of particular positions by
particular males, and concludes thus: "It would
seem from this that, like the Ruffs, each male
Blackcock has its particular domain on the
assembly ground, though the size of this is in
proportion to the much greater space of the
whole. On the other mornings, too, the same
birds, as I now make no doubt they are,
have flown down into approximately the same
areas."</p>

<p>The cliff-breeding species&mdash;Guillemots, Razorbills,
and Puffins&mdash;are difficult to investigate
because individuals vary so little, and the sexes
resemble one another so closely; yet, despite
these difficulties, we can gain some idea of the
general purport of their activities. But when
the ledges are crowded and the air is filled with
countless multitudes, how is it possible to keep
a single bird in view for a sufficient length of
time to understand its routine? The difficulty
is not an insuperable one. The flights, undertaken
seemingly for no particular purpose, are
often of short duration and are completed before
the strain of observation becomes too great;
moreover an individual sometimes possesses a
special mark or characteristic which serves to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
make it conspicuous. For example, there is a
well-marked variety of the Common Guillemot,
the Ringed or Bridled Guillemot of science,
distinguished by an unusual development of
white round the eye and along the furrow
behind it. One such individual I was fortunate
in discovering upon a crowded cliff, and, as in
the case of the Lapwing with the broken
leg or the Yellow Bunting with the injured
foot, the identity of the bird was beyond dispute,
and one could observe that it appropriated
to itself a particular position upon a particular
ledge.</p>

<p>Guillemots and Razorbills return at intervals
to the breeding stations early in the season, and
these visits are repeated with growing frequency
until the birds are finally established. I have
witnessed these periodic returns during March
in the south of England, and during April in
the north-west of Ireland, and I am informed
that in the latter district such visits may occur
as early as February. G&auml;tke, who had ample
opportunity of observing the birds in Heligoland,
puts their return at an even earlier date. "They
visit their breeding places," he says, "in flocks
of thousands at the New Year, often even as
early as December, as though they wanted to
make sure of their former haunts being well
preserved and ready for their reception." Such
visits, however, are irregular in occurrence; the
birds arrive, and, after spending a short time
upon the ledges, disappear. And since there is
not the same evidence in their coming and going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of that method which we observe in the
periodical returns of the Bunting or the Finch,
it may be thought that needless importance
is being attached to an episode in their lives
which is quite intelligible in terms of a feeble
response determined by a dawning organic
change. While it may be quite intelligible in
such terms it is not thereby explained; for
every response must have as its antecedent an
inherited connection in the nervous system
determined on biological grounds. Besides,
these early periodic returns conform in general
to the type of behaviour displayed by other
species, the males of which return to their breeding
grounds many weeks before the real business
of reproduction begins. Are we then justified in
regarding them as accidents of the developing
situation? Are we not rather bound to admit
that they have some definite biological end to
serve?</p>

<p class="tb">These examples show that the males of many
species reverse their mode of life at the commencement
of the breeding season and proceed
to isolate themselves, each one in a definitely
delimited area.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which we may
attempt to interpret this particular mode of
male behaviour. We may regard it as an
accidental circumstance, nowise influencing the
course of subsequent procedure; or, appealing
to the law of habit formation, we may
regard it as an individual acquirement; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
again, we may invest it with a deeper significance
and seek its origin in some specific
congenital disposition determined on purely
biological grounds.</p>

<p>Which of these three shall we choose? The
first by itself requires but little consideration;
for though it might explain the initial visit, it
cannot account for the persistency with which
the plot of ground is afterwards resorted to.
Supposing, however, that we combine the first
and the second; supposing, that is to say, we
assume, for the purpose of argument, that the
initial visit is fortuitous, and that constancy is
supplied by habit formation&mdash;would that be a
satisfactory interpretation? It is a simple one,
inasmuch as it only requires that a male shall
alight by chance in a particular place for a few
mornings in succession in order that the process
may be set in motion. Now an essential condition
of habit formation is recurrent repetition;
given this repetition and, it is true, any mode of
activity is liable to become firmly established.
But how can we explain the repetition? Even
if we are justified in assuming that the initial
visit is purely an accidental occurrence, we
cannot presume too far upon the laws of chance
and assume that the repetition, at first, is also
fortuitous.</p>

<p>So that we come back to the congenital
basis, the last of our three propositions. And it
will, I think, be admitted that the facts give us
some grounds for believing that the securing of
the territory has its root in the inherited con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>stitution
of the bird. In comparing the behaviour
of the migratory male with that of the resident,
attention was drawn to the manner in which
the occupation of a territory was effected: the
former bird, it may be remembered, established
itself without delay, whereas the latter did so
only by degrees, and the difference was attributed
to the incidence of migration which required
a closer correspondence between organic process
and external environment. But the significance
for us just now lies in the fact that the definiteness,
which accompanies the initial behaviour of
the migratory male in relation to the territory,
cannot have been acquired by repetition; for
this reason, that when the male occupies its
space of ground at the end of its long and
arduous journey, it does so without preparation
or experiment, even without hesitation, as if
aware that it was making good the first step in
the process of reproduction. No doubt, if it
happened to be an individual that had already
experienced the enjoyment of reproduction, it
might be aware of the immediate results to be
achieved and act accordingly. But among the
hosts of migrants that one observes, there must
be many males which have not previously mated;
and yet, upon arrival, they all behave in a
similarly definite manner&mdash;so that experience
cannot well be the primary factor in the situation.
If, then, the essential condition of habit
formation is absent and experience is eliminated,
there is nothing left but racial preparation to fall
back upon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>Nevertheless, it is true that many resident
males seem to pass through a period of indecision
before they establish themselves permanently
in their respective territories; they come and
go, their visits grow more and more prolonged,
and only after the lapse of some
considerable time does the process of establishment
attain that degree of completeness which
is represented in the initial behaviour of the
migratory male. Their whole procedure seems
therefore to bear the stamp of individual acquirement;
and, if it stood alone, we might be
content to construe it thus, but the example
of the migratory male necessitates our looking
elsewhere for the real meaning of the
indecision.</p>

<p>Let me first of all give some instances of the
persistence with which a male remains in one
spot, and this despite the fact that it has
no mate.</p>

<p>A Reed-Bunting occupied a central territory
in a strip of marshy ground inhabited annually
by four or five males of this species. Throughout
April, May, and until the 19th June, it
clung to its small plot of ground, tolerated no
intrusion, and sang incessantly.</p>

<p>Two Whitethroats arrived at much the
same time&mdash;the 30th April approximately&mdash;and
occupied the corner of a small plantation;
the one obtained a mate the day following
its arrival, the other remained unpaired for a
fortnight.</p>

<p>A Reed-Warbler established itself amongst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
some willows and alders adjoining a reed-bed
and made its headquarters in a small willow
bush. Not more than fifteen yards away, on the
edge of the main portion of the reeds, another
male was established and was paired on the 22nd
May. Each morning the single male behaved
in much the same way, singing continuously
whilst perched upon the bush. And so the
days passed by until it seemed improbable
that it would ever secure a mate, but one
appeared on the 20th June, and a nest was built
forthwith.</p>

<p>Now it is difficult to believe that a chance
visit, even though repeated for a few mornings
in succession, could have accounted for the
Reed-Bunting remaining so persistently in the
marsh, or the Whitethroat in one corner of the
osier bed, or the Reed-Warbler in that one
particular willow. Not only so, but if a habit of
such evident strength can be acquired so readily,
we have a right to ask why it should only be
acquired in the spring&mdash;why not at every season?
Considerations such as these lead to the belief
that there must be some congenital basis to
account for such persistent endeavour; the more
so since it is difficult not to be impressed with
the conative aspect of the male's behaviour. To
a stranger, unacquainted with its previous
history, the bird might appear to be leading a
life of hesitation, whereas, if carefully watched,
its whole attitude will be found to betray
symptoms of a striving towards some end; and
the frequent departure and return, which might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
be pointed to as the material from which a
definite mode of procedure would be likely to
emerge, is in reality behaviour of a determinate
sort.</p>

<p>My interpretation, then, of the apparent
indecision in the behaviour of the resident male
is this. During the winter most species live in
societies, together they seek their food and
together they retire in the evening to the
accustomed roosting places; and the association
of different individuals confers mutual benefits
upon the associates. The movements of these
societies are dominated by the question of food;
all else is subservient, and the supply of the
necessary sustenance may, under certain conditions,
become a difficulty which can only be
met by energy and resource. After the long
night the sensation of hunger is strong, and the
birds, on awakening, fly to the accustomed
feeding grounds, returning again in the evening
to the selected spot, and by frequent repetition
a routine becomes established. Thus
the behaviour of each individual is determined
not only by the powerful gregarious impulse
but also by the habits formed in connection
therewith during many weeks in succession.
Now with the rise of the appropriate organic
state, the disposition to seek the breeding
ground and there to establish itself becomes
dominant in the male. But the process is a
gradual one. There is no need, as happens
amongst the migrants, for the period of organic
change to conform rigidly to the growth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
any particular condition in the environment,
and hence for a time the bird oscillates between
two modes of behaviour&mdash;between that one
organised by frequent repetition and that one
determined by the functioning of this new
disposition.</p>

<p>To look at the matter broadly, it is scarcely
likely that so definite a mode of behaviour would
recur with such regularity, generation after
generation, in the individuals belonging to so
many widely divergent forms, if it had no root
in the inborn constitution of the bird. But the
law of habit formation has its part to play also.
By itself it is inadequate; yet it probably does
assist very materially in adding still greater
definition, and it probably is responsible in a
large measure for determining the limits of
the territory according to the conditions of
existence of the species&mdash;thus the Falcon
seeks its prey over wide tracts of land, and,
by hunting over certain ground repeatedly,
establishes a routine, which broadly fixes the
area occupied; the Woodpecker cannot find
food upon every tree, and every forest does
not contain the necessary trees, and therefore
the bird regulates its flight according to the
position of the trees; and the Warbler, finding
food close at hand, does not need to travel
far, and the area it occupies is consequently
small.</p>

<p>So that the most likely solution of the
problem will be found in a combination of our
second and third propositions; that is to say, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
an initial responsive behaviour provided for in
the inherited constitution of the nervous system,
and in a definiteness acquired by repetition and
determined by relationships in the external
environment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE DISPOSITION TO DEFEND THE TERRITORY</h4>


<p>In the previous chapter I endeavoured to show
that each male establishes a territory at the
commencement of the breeding season, and there
isolates itself from members of its own sex.
And further I gave my reasons for believing
that this particular mode of behaviour is determined
by the inherited nature of the bird, and
that we are justified in speaking of it as "a
disposition to secure a territory" because we can
perceive its prospective value. But the act of
establishment is only one step towards "securing."
By itself it can achieve nothing; for any number
of different individuals might fix upon the same
situation, and if there were nothing in the
inherited constitution of the bird to prevent
this happening, where would be the security, or
how could any benefit accrue to the species?</p>

<p>In withdrawing from its companions in the
spring, the male is breaking with the past, and
this action marks a definite change in its routine
of existence. But the change does not end in
attempted isolation; it is carried farther and
extends to the innermost life and affects what,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
humanly speaking, we should term its emotional
nature, so that the bird becomes openly hostile
towards other males with whom previously it
had lived on amicable terms.</p>

<p>The seasonal organic condition is responsible
for the functioning of the disposition which
results in this intolerance, just as it is for
the functioning of the disposition which leads
to the establishment of the territory; and the
effect of these two dispositions is that a space of
ground is not only occupied but made secure
from intrusion. The process is a simple one.
There is no reason to believe, there is no
necessity to believe, that any part of the procedure
is conditioned by anticipatory meaning;
the behaviour is "instinctive" in Professor
Lloyd Morgan's definition of the word, since it
is of a "specific congenital type, dependent upon
purely biological conditions, nowise guided by
conscious experience though affording data for
the life of consciousness."</p>

<p>That the males of many animals are apt to
become quarrelsome during the mating period is
notorious. Darwin collected a number of facts,
many of which related to birds, showing the
nature and extent of the strife when the sexual
instinct dominated the situation. And pondering
over these facts, he deduced therefrom a "law of
battle," which, he believed, bore a direct relation
to the possession of a female. And it must
be admitted that he had excellent ground for his
conclusion in the fact not only that the conflicts
occur mainly during the pairing season, but that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the female is often a spectator and seems even to
pair with the victor. I accepted it, therefore, as
the most reasonable interpretation of the facts.
But, as time passed by, incidents of a conflicting
character led me to think that after all there
might be another solution of the problem. And
when it was no longer possible to doubt that
there was a widespread tendency to establish
territories, it at once became manifest that the
battles might have an important part to play in
the whole scheme. But how was this to be
proved? What sort of evidence could show
whether the proximate end for which the males
were fighting had reference to the female or to
the territory? Clearly nothing but a complete
record of the whole series of events leading up
to reproduction could supply the necessary data
upon which a decision might rest. In the
present chapter I shall give, in the first place,
the reasons which lead me to think that the
origin of the fighting cannot be traced to the
female; afterwards, the evidence which seems to
show that it must be sought in the territory;
and finally, I shall make a suggestion as to the
part the female may play in the whole scheme.</p>

nature of the injuries from which it succumbed." title="Male Blackbirds fighting for the possession of territory.
The bare skin on the crown of the defeated bird shows the
nature of the injuries from which it succumbed." /></div>

<p>The facts upon which the "law of battle"
was founded were ample to establish the truth of
its main doctrine. But the evidence upon which
the interpretation of the battles was based was
somewhat superficial. It was based mainly upon
the general observation that one or more females
could frequently be observed to accompany the
combatants; and if this were the sole condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
under which the fighting occurred, one must
admit that this view would have much to
recommend it. But it is not merely a question
of males disputing in the presence of a female;
for males fight when no female is present, pair
attacks pair, or a male may even attack a female&mdash;in
fact there is a complexity of strife which is
bewildering.</p>

<p>In attributing the rivalry to the presence
of the female, it is assumed that males are in
a preponderance, and that consequently two or
more are always ready to compete for a mate.
Her presence is presumably the condition under
which his pugnacious nature is rendered susceptible
to its appropriate stimulus, the stimulus
being, of course, supplied by the opponent.
There would be nothing against this interpretation
if it were in accord with the facts; but it
can, I think, be shown that the males are just
as pugnacious and the conflicts just as severe
even when the question of securing a mate
is definitely excluded; and I shall now give the
evidence which has led me to this conclusion.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we had occasion to
refer to the difference in the times of arrival
of the male and female migrants, and we
came to the conclusion, it may be remembered,
that this was a fact of some importance,
because it gave us a clue to the meaning
of much that was otherwise obscure in their
behaviour. But it is also of importance in
connection with the particular aspect of the
problem which we now have in view, for if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
can be shown that males, when they first reach
their breeding grounds, are even then intolerant
of one another's presence, if their actions and
attitudes betray similar symptoms of quasi-conation,
if disputes are rife and the struggles
of a kind to preclude all doubt as to their
reality, then it is manifest that in such cases
their intolerance cannot be due to the presence
of the female.</p>

<p>Here, however, I must refer to a view which
is held by some psychologists, namely, that
amongst the higher animals, even on the
occasion of the first performance of an instinctive
act, there is some vague awareness of the
proximate end to be attained. Discussing the
nature of instincts, Dr M'Dougall<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> says, "Nor
does our definition insist, as some do, that the
instinctive action is performed without awareness
of the end towards which it tends, for this,
too, is not essential; it may be, and in the case
of the lower animals no doubt often is, so
performed, as also by the very young child,
but in the case of the higher animals some
prevision of the immediate end, however vague,
probably accompanies an instinctive action that
has often been repeated." A similar view seems
to be held by Dr Stout.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> "As I have already
shown," he says, "animals in their instinctive
actions do actually behave from the outset as
if they were continuously interested in the
development of what is for them one and the
same situation or course of events; they actually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>behave as if they were continuously attentive,
looking forward beyond the immediately present
experience in preparation for what is to come.
They apparently watch, wait, search, are on the
alert. They also behave exactly as if they
appreciated a difference between relative success
and failure, trying again when a certain perceptible
result is not attained and varying their
procedure in so far as it has been unsuccessful.
All these characters are found in the first nest-building
of birds as well as in the second; they
are found also in courses of conduct which occur
only once in the lifetime of the animal." Both
these writers would, I imagine, contend that,
even when a female is absent, the idea of the
female, as the end in view throughout, is
present; and they would argue that the fact
of her absence during the fighting in no way
disposes of the belief that she is the condition
under which the pugnacious instinct of the
male is rendered susceptible to stimulation.
What reason is there to think that this interpretation
is applicable to the case under consideration?
When a female is present, we
observe that the males are pugnacious, and,
when she is absent, that they still continue to
be hostile&mdash;that is to say, they behave <i>as if</i> she
were present. Now, as far as I can ascertain,
the "<i>as if</i>" is the only ground there is for
supposing that the female is represented in
imaginal form&mdash;there is no evidence of the
fact, if fact it be. On the contrary, the behaviour
of the male affords some fairly conclusive evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
that no such image is the primary factor in
exciting the instinctive reaction. For if it be
the actual presence of the female, or, in the
absence of such, a mental image, that renders
the pugnacious nature of the male responsive;
provided the usual stimulus were present, the
instinct ought surely to respond, not only under
one particular circumstance, but under all
circumstances. Yet, as we shall presently see,
a male is by no means consistently intolerant
of other males. It may be sociable at one
moment or pugnacious at another, but the
pugnacity is always peculiar to a certain
occasion&mdash;the occupation of a territory. What
shall we say then&mdash;that a mental image is a
situational item only when the territory is
occupied? It may be so; it may be that the
fact of occupation gives rise to the mental image
which, in its turn, renders the fighting instinct
explosive, which again renders the possession
of the territory secure. That such an interpretation
is possible we must all admit. But
if it were true, though it would not affect
the main consideration, namely, whether the
fighting has reference to the possession of a
particular female, or to the protection of the
territory, it would make further discussion as
to which of these is the condition of the fighting
unprofitable, for each would have its part to
play in the process, the territory remaining,
however, the principal factor in the situation.</p>

<p>Now the difference in the times of arrival
of the male and female migrant varies in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
different species from a few days to a fortnight
or even more. It is most marked in those that
return to their breeding grounds early in the
season, and the greater the margin of difference
the greater scope is there for observation. In
my records for the past twelve years, there are
frequent references to these initial male contests in
the life of the Willow-Warbler and of the Chiffchaff;
and in the district which I have in mind,
these two species arrive early in the season, the
males preceding the females by a week or even
as much as a fortnight. Suppose, then, that two
Chiffchaffs establish themselves in adjoining
territories; or suppose that a male settles in a
territory already occupied; what is the result?
Well, scenes of hostility soon become apparent;
as the birds approach one another they become
more and more restive, their song ceases, they
no longer search for food in the usual methodical
manner, but instead their movements are hurried
and their call-notes are uttered rapidly&mdash;all of
which betrays a heightened emotional tone.
Then the climax is reached, there is a momentary
fluttering of tiny wings, a clicking of bills, and
for the time being that may be all. But unless
one or other of the combatants retires, this scene
may be repeated many times in the course of a
few hours, and repeated with varying degrees of
severity. Yet the fighting, even in the most
extreme form, when the birds locked together
fall slowly to the ground, is seldom of an
impressive kind, and one has to bear in mind
the capabilities of the actors, remembering that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the most severe struggle might readily be interpreted
as a game if it were not for certain
symptoms which reveal its inner nature.</p>

<p>The males of many other migrants can frequently
be observed to fight when there was
every reason to believe that females had still
to arrive. The Blackcap is notoriously pugnacious,
but not more so than the Marsh-Warbler
or the Whinchat. Here in Worcestershire, the
<i>Arundo phragmites</i> grows mainly on certain
sheets of water which are comparatively few
and far between, and the Reed-Warbler is
consequently restricted to isolated and more or
less confined areas. The males arrive early in
May before the new growth of reeds has
attained any considerable height, and each one
has its own position in the reed-bed, sings there,
and throughout the whole period of reproduction
actively resists intrusion on the part of other
males. I have kept watch upon a small area
of reeds daily from the date of the first arrival;
each individual was known to me, and as the
growing reeds were only a few inches in height,
a female could scarcely have escaped detection.
Yet time and again disputes arose, and males
pursued and pecked one another, striving to
attain that isolation for which racial preparation
had fitted them.</p>

<p>But on account of their violence, or their
novelty, or because the absence of a female was
beyond question, some battles stand out in one's
memory more prominently than others. An
instance of this was a struggle between two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Whitethroats which happened in the latter part
of April and lasted for three successive days.
The scene of its occurrence was more or less the
same on each occasion, and the area over which
the birds wandered was comparatively small.
The fighting was characterised by persistent
effort and was of a most determined kind, and
so engrossed did the assailants become that they
even fluttered to the ground at my feet. No
trace of a female was to be seen at any time
during these three days, nor, during the pauses
in the conflict, was the emotional behaviour of
a kind which led me to suppose that a female
was anywhere in the vicinity. And, if she had
been near, she must have made her presence
known, for the belief that she is a timid creature,
skulking on such occasions in the undergrowth,
is by no means borne out by experience.</p>

<p>Even more impressive was a battle between
two male Cuckoos. It occurred high up in the
air above the tops of some tall elm-trees which
roughly marked the boundary line between their
respective areas, and the actions of the birds
were plainly visible. At the moment of actual
collision the opponents were generally in a
vertical position, and wings, feet, and beaks were
made use of in turn; one could plainly see them
strike at one another with their feet, and one
could observe the open bill which generally
denotes exhaustion, but may of course have been
due to anger, or used as a means of producing
terror. Yet no female appeared in the locality until
six days after the occurrence of this struggle&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
she certainly is not easily overlooked, for her
note is unmistakable even when the behaviour of
the male does not betray her arrival.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f111" id="f111"></a><img src="images/fig111.jpg" width="500" height="756" alt="Male Cuckoos
fighting before the arrival of a female." title="Male Cuckoos fighting
before the arrival of a female." /></div>

<p>That the actual presence of the respective
females exercised any influence on the course of
these struggles is more than doubtful. Not only
did one fail to detect them, but one's failure to
do so was confirmed by the knowledge that they
had not yet arrived in those particular localities.
Hence the fact of the male preceding the female
is a valuable aid to the interpretation of subsequent
behaviour; and one appreciates it the
more after having experienced the difficulty of
deciding whether she is present during the
conflicts between resident males, for no matter
how carefully we may observe the conditions
which lead up to, and which accompany, such
conflicts, or how closely we may scrutinise the
surrounding trees, undergrowth, or ground, there
always remains the possibility that she may,
after all, have been overlooked. But this must
not be taken to imply that in such cases direct
observation alone can lead to no serviceable
result, or that the evidence gained therefrom is
worthless. Far from it. Failure to detect a
female is so very common an occurrence that,
even if we lacked the corroborative evidence
supplied in the life of the migratory male, it
would still be unreasonable to suppose that it
were solely due to mistaken observation. We
mark her absence during the conflicts between
the respective males of many common species&mdash;the
Finches, Buntings, and Thrushes that occupy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
their territories early in the season when the
hedgerows and trees are still bare; but more frequently
amongst those that inhabit open ground,
because the movements of the birds are there
more accessible to observation. For instance,
half a dozen or more Lapwings can be kept in
view at the same time, and as they stand at dawn
in solitary state, keeping watch upon their respective
territories, they are conspicuous objects on
the short, frosted grass; no stranger can enter the
arena without the observer being aware of it, no
commotion can occur but one detects it, no
movement however small need be missed. And
so they fight, in a manner which leaves no doubt
as to the reality of the struggle, when their
prospective mates are absent not only from the
particular territories in which the conflicts take
place, but absent too from those adjoining.</p>

<p>If the fact that males fight before they are
paired and in the absence of a female could be
placed beyond all question, it would no longer
be possible to regard her possession as the end
for which they are contending, and consequently
there would be no need to produce further
evidence. But the examples which I have given
refer, of course, to only a few migrants and a few
residents&mdash;and moreover it must be admitted
that a female <i>is</i> often conspicuous during the
battles&mdash;so that by themselves they must
be regarded, and rightly so, as inconclusive.
We must therefore pass on to consider evidence
of a somewhat different character.</p>

<p>I spoke of the complexity of the strife. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
this I mean that it is not merely a matter of
disputes between adjoining males, but that it
is a far more comprehensive business involving
both sexes. Thus female fights with female and
pair with pair, or a male will attack a female, or,
again, a pair will combine against a single male
or a single female. And from all this complexity
of strife we gain much valuable evidence
in regard to the question immediately before us.
For when one pair attacks another, or males
that are definitely paired fight with one another,
or an unpaired male attacks either sex of a
neighbouring pair indiscriminately, there is
surely little ground for supposing that the
possession of a mate is the reason of it all.</p>

<p>The battles between pairs of the same species
are by no means uncommon. Observe, for
example, the central pair of three pairs of Reed-Buntings
occupying adjoining territories, and
keep a daily record of the routine of activity
practised by both sexes during the early hours
of the morning; then, at the close of the season,
summarise all the fighting under different headings,
and it will be found that the number of
occasions upon which the central pair attacked,
or was attacked by, neighbouring pairs will form
a considerable portion of the whole.</p>

<p>Or watch the Moor-Hen, and for the purpose
choose some sheet of water large enough to
accommodate three or more pairs, and so situated
that the birds can always be kept in view.
Early in February the pool will be haunted
by numbers of individuals of both sexes, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
swimming about together, and, if the pool is
surrounded by arable land, wandering over that
land subject to no territorial restrictions, apparently
free to seek food where they will. But as
time goes by, their number gradually decreases
until a few pairs only remain, and these will
occupy definite areas. If careful watch is then
kept and the relations of the pairs closely
studied, there will be no difficulty in observing
the particular kind of warfare to which I
am alluding, and it will be noticed that the
encounters are of a particularly violent description.
Thus two pairs approach one another,
and, when they meet, throw themselves upon
their backs, each bird striking at its adversary
with its feet or seizing hold of it with its beak;
and though, in the commotion that ensues, it is
almost impossible to determine what exactly is
happening, there is reason to believe that the
sexes attack one another indiscriminately.</p>

<p>A struggle between two pairs of Pied Wagtails
is worth mentioning. It impressed itself
upon my memory because of the unusual vigour
with which it was conducted. The battle lasted
for fifteen minutes or more, and the four birds,
collecting together, pursued and attacked one
another&mdash;at one moment in the air, at another
upon the roof of a house where they would
alight and flutter about on the slates, uttering
their call-note without ceasing&mdash;until finally
they disappeared from view, still, however, continuing
the struggle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f117" id="f117"></a><img src="images/fig117.jpg" width="500" height="756" alt="Two pairs of Pied Wagtails fighting
in defence of their territories." title="Two pairs of Pied Wagtails fighting
in defence of their territories." /></div>

<p>Such is the nature of the warfare which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
prevails between neighbouring pairs, and which
can be observed in the life of many other
species&mdash;the Chaffinch, Stonechat, Blackbird,
Partridge, Jay, to mention but a few.</p>

<p>The conflicts between males that are
definitely paired are of such common occurrence
that it is scarcely necessary to mention specific
instances. But the occasions on which a male
attacks either sex of a neighbouring pair indiscriminately,
or on which a pair combine to
attack a female, are less frequent.</p>

<p>Now if it be true that males fight for no other
purpose than to gain possession of a mate, what
meaning are we to attach to the battles between
the pairs, or what explanation are we to give
of the fact that paired males are so frequently
hostile? Those who hold this view will probably
argue thus: "The presence of the female
is the condition under which the pugnacious
instinct of the male is rendered susceptible
to appropriate stimulation, and the stimulus
is supplied by a rival male; we admit that
all the fighting which occurs after pairing has
taken place has nothing to do strictly speaking
with gaining a mate, but, inasmuch as the
fact of possession is always liable to be challenged&mdash;and
no male can differentiate between a paired
and an unpaired intruder&mdash;we contend that it
would add to the security of possession if the
pugnacious instinct remained susceptible to
stimulation so long as there were any possibility
of challenge from an unpaired male; and we
think that the waste of energy involved in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the struggles between paired birds, and which
we grant is purposeless, would be more than
balanced by the added security." This is a
possible explanation and requires consideration.
It cannot account for all the diverse ways in
which the sexes are mixed up in the fighting&mdash;it
cannot, for instance, explain the fact that an
unpaired male will attack either sex of an
adjoining pair indiscriminately&mdash;but nevertheless
it appears at first sight to be a reasonable
explanation of some of them. We must
remember, however, that fighting continues
throughout the whole period of reproduction.
Even after the discharge of the sexual function
has ceased, and the female is engaged in incubation
or in tending her young, the male is still
intolerant of intruders; and it is difficult to
believe that, at so late a stage in the process, a
female could be any attraction sexually to an
unpaired male. But apart from any theoretical
objection, there remains the fact&mdash;namely that
there is no evidence that a male, after having
once paired, is liable to be robbed of its mate.
And in support of this fact I have only to state
that I have met with no single instance of
failure to obtain and hold a mate when once a
territory had been secured. Bearing in mind
then that both sexes participate in the fighting,
and that individuals of the opposite sex frequently
attack one another; that all such
conflicts are characterised by persistent effort,
and that they are not limited to just the
particular period when the sexual instinct is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
dominant but continue throughout the breeding
season; bearing in mind that in at least one
form of this promiscuous warfare the influence
of the female can be definitely excluded, and
that, in the remaining forms, the evidence which
is required to link them up with the biological
end of securing mates is lacking&mdash;can it be
denied that the complexity of the strife makes
against the view that the possession of a female
is the proximate end for which the males are
fighting?</p>

<p class="tb">We started with the most simple aspect of
the whole problem, the fighting of two males in
the presence of one female&mdash;the aspect upon
which attention has usually been fixed. And if
it remained at that, if observation failed to
disclose any further development in the situation,
then there would be no need to probe the
matter deeper, there would be no reason to
doubt the assertion that the quarrel had direct
reference to the female. But assuredly no one
can ponder over the diversity of battle and
still believe that the possession of a mate
furnishes an adequate solution of the mystery.
Clearly such an hypothesis cannot cover all
the known facts; there are conflicts between
separate pairs, and there are conflicts between
males when females are known to be absent and
when their mates are even engaged in the work
of incubation&mdash;these cannot be due to an
impulse in a member of one sex to gain or keep
possession of one of the other sex. So that
taking all these facts into consideration, we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
justified, I think, in hesitating to accept this
view, and must look elsewhere for the real
condition under which the pugnacious nature of
the male is rendered susceptible to appropriate
stimulation.</p>

<p>What then is the meaning of all this
warfare? The process of reproduction is a
complex one, built up of a number of different
parts forming one inter-related whole; it is
not merely a question of "battle," or of
"territory," or of "song," or of "emotional
manifestation," but of all these together. The
fighting is thus one link in a chain of events
whose end is the attainment of reproduction;
it is a relationship in an inter-related process,
and to speak of it as being even directly related
to the territory is scarcely sufficient, for it
is intimately associated with the disposition
which is manifested in the isolation of the
male from its companions, and forms therewith
an <i>imperium in imperio</i> from which our
concept of breeding territory is taken. But
let me say at once that it is no easy matter to
prove this, for since so many modes of behaviour,
which can be interpreted as lending support to
this view, are likewise interpretable on the view
that the presence of a female is a necessary condition
of the fighting, it is difficult to find just
the sort of evidence that is required. Nevertheless,
after hearing the whole of the evidence and
at the same time keeping in mind the conclusion
which we have already reached, I venture to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
think that the close relationship between the
warfare on the one hand and the territory on the
other will be fully admitted.</p>

<p>Formerly I deemed the spring rivalry to
be the result of accidental encounters, and I
believed that an issue to a struggle was only
reached when one of the combatants succumbed
or disappeared from the locality, a view which
neither recognised method nor admitted control.
Recent experience has shown, however, that I
was wrong, and that there is a very definite
control over and above that which is supplied by
the physical capabilities of the birds.</p>

<p>Let us take some common species, the
Willow-Warbler being our first example; and,
having found three adjoining territories occupied
by unpaired males, let us study the conflicts
at each stage in the sexual life of the three
individuals, observing them before females have
arrived upon the scene, again when one or two
of the three males have secured mates, and yet
again when all three have paired. Now we
shall find that the conditions which lead up
to and which terminate the conflicts are remarkably
alike at each of these periods. A male
intrudes, and the intrusion evokes an immediate
display of irritation on the part of the owner
of the territory, who, rapidly uttering its song
and jerking its wings, begins hostilities. Flying
towards the intruder, it attacks viciously, and
there follows much fluttering of wings and
snapping or clicking of bills. At one moment
the birds are in the tree-tops, at another in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
air, and sometimes even on the ground, and
fighting thus they gradually approach and
pass beyond the limits of the territory. Whereupon
a change comes over the scene; the male
whose territory was intruded upon and who all
along had displayed such animosity, betrays
no further interest in the conflict&mdash;it ceases to
attack, searches around for food, or sings, and
slowly makes its way back towards the centre
of the territory.</p>

<p>Scenes of this kind are of almost daily
occurrence wherever a species is so common,
or the environment to which it is adapted so
limited in extent, that males are obliged to
occupy adjacent ground. The Moor-Hen abounds
on all suitable sheets of water, and it is a bird
that can be conveniently studied because, as
a rule, there is nothing, except the rushes that
fringe the pool, to hinder us from obtaining a
panoramic view of the whole proceedings, and
moreover the area occupied by each individual
is comparatively small. Towards the middle of
February, symptoms of sexual organic change
make themselves apparent, and the pool is then
no longer the resort of a peaceable community;
quarrels become frequent, and as different
portions of the surface of the water are gradually
appropriated, so the fighting becomes more
incessant and more severe. Each individual
has its own particular territory, embracing a
piece of open water as well as a part of the rush-covered
fringe, within which it moves and lives.
But in the early part of the season, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
territories are still in process of being established,
and definiteness has still to be acquired, trespassing
is of frequent occurrence, and the
conflicts are often conspicuous for their severity.</p>

<p>Now these conflicts are not confined to
unpaired individuals, nor to one sex, nor to
one member of a pair&mdash;every individual that
has settled upon the pool for the purpose of
breeding will at one time or another be involved
in a struggle with its neighbour. If then we
single out certain pairs and day by day observe
their actions and their attitude towards intruders,
we shall notice that, instead of their routine of
existence consisting, as a casual acquaintance
with the pool and its inmates might lead us
to believe, of an endless series of meaningless
disputes, the behaviour of each individual is
directed towards a similar goal&mdash;the increasing
of the security of its possession; and further,
if we pay particular attention to the circumstances
which lead up to the quarrels and the
circumstances under which such quarrels come
to an end, we shall find, when we have accumulated
a sufficient body of observations, that the
disputes always originate in trespass, and that
hostilities always cease when the trespasser
returns again to its own territory. By careful
observation it is possible to make oneself
acquainted with the boundaries&mdash;I know not
what other term to use&mdash;which separate this
territory from that; and it is the conduct of the
birds on or near these boundaries to which
attention must be drawn. A bird may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
feeding quietly in one corner of its territory
when an intruder enters. Becoming aware of
what is happening it ceases to search for food,
and approaching the intruder, at first swimming
slowly but gradually increasing its pace, it
finally rises and attacks with wings and beak,
and drives its rival back again beyond the
boundary. Thereupon its attitude undergoes
a remarkable change; ceasing to attack, but
remaining standing for a few moments as if
still keeping guard, it betrays no further interest
in the bird with which a few seconds previously
it was fighting furiously. On one occasion I
watched a trespasser settle upon a conspicuous
clump of rushes situated near the boundary.
The owner, who was at the moment some
distance away, approached in the usual manner,
and, having driven off the trespasser, returned
immediately to the clump, where it remained
erect and motionless.</p>

<p>A feature which marks all the fighting, and
which we cannot afford to disregard, is the
conative aspect of the behaviour of the owner of
the territory. The bird attacks with apparent
deliberation <i>as if</i> it were striving to attain some
definite end. I recollect an incident which was
interesting from this point of view. A pair of
Reed-Buntings were disturbed by a Weasel
which had approached their nest containing
young. Both birds betrayed symptoms of
excitement; as the Weasel threaded its way
amongst the rushes, so they fluttered from
clump to clump or clung to the stems, uttering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
a note which is peculiar to times of distress, and
followed it thus until finally it disappeared in
a hedge. The rapidly uttered note and the
excitement of the birds caused some commotion,
and the male from an adjoining territory
approached the scene. Now one would have
expected that the presence of this bird, and
possibly its aid in driving away a common
enemy, would have been welcomed; one would
have thought that all else would have been
subservient to the common danger, and that
so real a menace to the offspring would have
evoked an impulse in the parent powerful enough
to dominate the situation and subordinate all the
activities of the bird to the attainment of its end.
But what happened? Three times during this
incident, the male, whose young were in danger,
abandoned the pursuit of the Weasel and
pursued the intruder. It was not merely that
he objected to the presence of this neighbouring
male in a passive way, nor even that he had
a momentary skirmish with it, but that he
determinedly drove the intruder beyond the
boundary and only then returned to harass the
Weasel.</p>

<p>Thus it seems clear that the proximate end to
which the fighting is directed is not necessarily
the defeat of the intruder, but its removal from a
certain position. And inasmuch as this result
will be obtained whether the retreat is brought
about by fear of an opponent or by physical
exhaustion, it is manifest that too much significance
need not be attached to the amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
injury inflicted. It is necessary to bear this in
mind, because it is held by some, who have
carefully observed the actions of various species,
that overmuch importance is attached to the
conflicts, that in a large number of instances
they are mere "bickerings" and lead to nothing,
and that they are now only "formal," which
means, I suppose, that they are vestigial&mdash;fragments
of warfare that determined the survival
of the species in bygone ages. But if the
conclusion at which we have just arrived be
correct, if we can recognise a single aim passing
through the whole of the warfare&mdash;and that one
the removal of an intruder from a certain
position, then we need no longer concern ourselves
as to the degree of severity of the battles&mdash;we
see it all in true perspective. Neither
exhaustion nor physical inability are the sole
factors which determine the nature and extent of
the fighting; there is a more important factor
still&mdash;position. According, that is to say, to the
position which a bird occupies whilst fighting is
in progress, so its pugnacious nature gains or
loses susceptibility, and it is this gain or loss of
susceptibility which I refer to when I speak of
the fighting as being controlled.</p>

<p>What we have then to consider is the relation
of "susceptibility" to "position." We can
explain the relationship in two ways. We can
say that the part of the nature of the male which
leads to the occupation of a territory, and is
partly hereditary and partly acquired, is stronger
than the part which leads the bird to fight, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
which is conditioned by the presence of a female,
and that consequently when the male passes the
boundary, the impulse to return asserts itself and
the conflict ceases; or we can say that the
occupation of a territory is the condition under
which the pugnacious instinct is rendered susceptible
to stimulation, that the stimulus is
supplied by the intruder, and that when the male
passes outside the accustomed area its instinct is
no longer so susceptible and it therefore retires
from the conflict.</p>

Males fighting for possession of territory. The feathers

Males fighting for possession of territory. The feathers
have been torn from the crown of the defeated and dying rival." /></div>

<p>Of these explanations, the first is not altogether
satisfactory. It requires the presence of
a female and, as we have seen, a female is by
no means always present. Then it attributes to
the one side of the inherited nature an influence
which is not borne out by the facts, for in the
ordinary routine of existence, without the incentive
of battle, every individual is liable to wander
occasionally beyond its boundary and to intrude
temporarily upon its neighbours; and this it
could scarcely do, providing its nature to remain
within the territory were powerful enough to
dominate its movements and curtail its activities
even during the excitement of an encounter.
But there is nothing inherently improbable in
the alternative hypothesis, nor anything that
is at all inconsistent with the behaviour as
observed; on the contrary, if it is admitted, the
facts become connected together and exhibit a
meaning which they otherwise would not have
possessed.</p>

<p>So much for the controlling influence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
"position," which alone seems to me sufficient
ground for believing that the fighting has reference
to the territory. But it is not the whole of
the evidence.</p>

<p>Now if it were possible to demonstrate by
actual observation that those males which had
not established territories were not pugnacious,
we should have something in the nature of proof
of the correctness of this view. Demonstrative
evidence of this kind is, however, unattainable.
Yet we can come very near to obtaining it by
reason of a peculiar feature which marks the process
of acquiring territory&mdash;the neutral ground.
The Lapwing will serve as an illustration. In
the previous chapter I referred to the small flocks
that appeared in the accustomed water meadow
early in February, and I described how they
settled day after day in that meadow, but only
in a limited part of it, where they passed their
time in rest, in preening their feathers, or in
running this way and that lazily searching for
food; and how, at length, the flock dwindled by
reason of individuals breaking away in order to
secure positions on the remaining part of the
meadow. Here the neutral ground is adjacent
to the territories, and, while still occupied by
the flock, is resorted to by the males that had
deserted that flock in order to establish those
territories.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we have the whole
meadow in view from some point of vantage.
In front of us are the territories, in the distance
the neutral ground; and in each territory there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
is a solitary male, while on the neutral ground
a number of individuals of both sexes are
assembled, and move about freely one amongst
another. So that the scene presented to view
is somewhat as follows: a flat meadow, at one
end of which, and at fairly regular intervals,
a few solitary individuals are dotted about, each
one keeping at a distance from its neighbours;
while at the other end a number of individuals
are collected together in a comparatively small
space, apparently deriving some satisfaction from
their close association. That surely is a very
remarkable contrast. But let us continue our
investigation, first fixing our attention upon the
solitary individuals; one is standing preening its
feathers, another is squatting upon the ground,
a third runs a few yards in this direction then a
few yards in that, stimulated apparently by the
sight of food, and so on. Moreover, each one
keeps strictly to a well-defined area and makes
no attempt to associate with its fellows. One of
the males, however, whilst roaming backwards
and forwards approaches the limit of its territory,
and this brings the neighbouring bird, whose
boundary is threatened, rapidly to the spot. In
an upright position both stand face to face, and
the battle then begins; with their wings they
attempt to beat one another about the body,
with their beaks they aim blows at the head,
and in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e wings and legs seem to be
inextricably mixed; whilst at intervals, driven
backwards by the force of the collision, they are
compelled to separate, only, however, to return to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the charge&mdash;and the sound of beating wings and
the feathers that float in the air are tokens of
earnestness. Such scenes are of frequent occurrence;
but the conflicts vary in intensity, and
the circumstances under which they occur vary
too, and females come and go without leaving
any clue as to their ultimate intentions.</p>

<p>Turning now to the flock one is impressed
with the friendship that seems to exist between
the various members. There are, it is true,
occasional displays of pugnacity which never
seem to develop into anything very serious; for
instance, one bird will fly at another, and a
momentary scuffle is followed by a short pursuit
but nothing more&mdash;nothing, that is to say, in
the least comparable with the battle previously
described. Of what is the flock composed?
Of members of both sexes. There is no difficulty
in assuring oneself that this is so. But is it
entirely composed of individuals in whom development
has not reached a stage adequate for the
functioning of the primary dispositions? No,
not entirely; for it will be observed that its
number is a fluctuating one, that birds come
and go, and, if a close watch is kept upon the
different individuals as they leave, it will be
noticed that some at least are inmates of the
territories at the opposite end of the meadow&mdash;the
solitary members whose behaviour we were
recently watching. This fact is an important
one. We were impressed, it may be remembered,
with the contrast between the general behaviour
of the birds at the opposite ends of the meadow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
But now it appears as if the contrast were not
between this individual and that, but between
the behaviour of the same one under different
circumstances. The male, that is to say, which,
while in its territory, tolerates the approach of
no other male, flies to the flock and is there
welcomed by the very individuals with whom a
short time previously it had been engaged in
serious conflict.</p>

<p>But if the conditions are reversed and the
flock happens to settle in an occupied territory,
the attitude of the owner towards the flock is
very different. In the year 1916 an incident
of this kind occurred in the meadow to which
reference has already been made. The weather
had been exceptionally severe&mdash;very cold easterly
and north-easterly winds, frost, and frequent
falls of snow had affected the behaviour of the
Lapwings, and seemed to have checked the
normal development of their sexual routine.
The males would attempt to establish themselves,
and then, when the temperature fell and
the ground was covered with snow, would collect
again in flocks and follow their winter routine.
It was on the 9th March, during one of the spells
of milder weather, that the flock on the neutral
ground was disturbed and settled mainly in
the territory marked No. 3 on the 1916 plan,
but partly on that marked No. 2. The owners
thereupon began to attack the different members
of the invading flock. Fixing attention upon a
particular bird whilst ignoring the remainder,
the No. 3 male drove it away, and then after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
a pause drove another away, and so on until
by degrees all the invaders were banished, and
the No. 2 male did likewise. The interest of
this incident lies, however, in the behaviour of
the different individuals of which the flock
was composed; when attacked they made no
real show of resistance, but accepted the situation
and left. The will to fight was clearly lacking,
yet their presence was a source of annoyance to
the owners of the territories. A short time
previously a female had accompanied one of
the males and was at that time somewhere in
the vicinity, but beyond this there was no
evidence to show that either of them were
paired, and even if the presence of the female
were the reason of the pugnacity of the one,
it could not well account for that of the
other.</p>

<p>The neutral ground does not always happen
to be so close at hand as in the case of the
meadow referred to. Sometimes the birds will
resort to a particular field, attracted probably
by a plentiful supply of food, and here they
collect and behave as they do during the winter,
running this way and that as the fancy takes
them, meeting together by accident at one
moment, parting at another, according to the
direction in which they happen to wander.
Of animosity there is little sign; the season
might be the middle of winter instead of the
middle of March for all the indication there
is of sexual development, and yet one knows
that they will behave differently when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
leave this ground, as presently they will, and
return to their territories in the surrounding
neighbourhood, and that there each one will
fight if necessary to preserve its acre from
intrusion.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, from this that the
fighting must bear some relation to the
particular area of ground in which it occurs;
and unless it can be shown that there is some
other factor in the external environment of
the male, that is the direction in which we
must look for the condition under which the
instinct is rendered susceptible. One's thoughts
turn, of course, to the female, but she too passes
backwards and forwards between the territories
and the neutral ground, and if her presence
were really a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> of the strife,
one would like to know why, when she leaves
those territories and joins the flock and the
males do likewise, similar conflicts should not
prevail there also.</p>

<p>Other species have their neutral ground, but
the environment seldom affords such facilities
for observation as does that of the Lapwing.
Even though the Moor-Hens, who are so
conspicuously intolerant upon the pool, <i>do</i> feed
together amicably upon the meadows adjoining;
and the Chaffinch that is so pugnacious in the
morning, <i>does</i> seek out the flock later in the
day; yet their conditions of existence prevent
our obtaining a panoramic view of the whole
proceeding, and we have to study each scene
separately before discovering that the relation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>ship
between intolerance and the territory
on the one hand, and friendship and the
neutral ground on the other, is just as strong
a feature as it is in the behaviour of the
Lapwing.</p>

<p>I shall now give a brief account of the
conduct of a male Reed-Bunting which by
persistent effort established itself late in the
season, and I shall do so because its behaviour
tends to confirm much that has been said in
the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Early in March three male Reed-Buntings
occupied a small water meadow overgrown
with the common rush, and by the third week
all of them were paired. On the 30th March
two of the males were unusually pugnacious,
and on the following day fighting continued
and at times was very severe. Now I knew
that the occupants of the ground in which
the fighting was taking place were paired,
and not doubting that the combatants were
the owners of two territories marked for
convenience sake Nos. 1 and 2, I was at a
loss to understand the meaning of so determined
and persistent a struggle. My attention, however,
was presently drawn to a third bird, which
also joined in the conflict and made the whole
situation still more perplexing. This bird, as
it soon became clear, was none other than the
owner of No. 2 territory, and the one that
I had previously regarded as such was a new
arrival. On the following day, the 1st April,
fighting continued, and in my record for that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
day there is a note to the effect that "No. 2
female seems to be of no interest to No. 5
male (the new arrival); its purpose seems to be
to drive away intruders." On the 2nd April
and subsequent days, this bird attacked every
other male that approached, and not only
maintained its position but ultimately succeeded
in securing a mate. Here then we have two
territories occupied by two males, both of
which had obtained a mate. The relation of
these two birds was normal, a month's routine
had defined their boundaries, and conflicts were
less frequent than formerly. But upon this
comparatively peaceful scene a strange male
intrudes. Observe the manner of the intrusion.
The stranger does not wander about first in
this direction and then in that, but acts <i>as if</i>
it had some definite end in view, and establishing
itself in a small alder bush which it
uses as a base or headquarters, it gradually
extends its dominion, gains the mastery over
the surrounding ground, part of which belonged
to No. 1 male and part to No. 2, and finally
drives a wedge, so to speak, between the two
territories.</p>

<p>How is its behaviour to be explained, and
why did its presence cause such commotion?
No one could have watched the gradual unfolding
of this incident day by day and not have been
impressed by the persistent endeavour with
which this male maintained its position in one
small part of the meadow. This is the first and
most important consideration. Then there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the attitude, also significant, which it adopted
towards the females; for I take it that, apart
from the question of territory, the explanation of
its intrusion must be sought in the necessity for
securing a mate&mdash;that it was attracted by the
presence of the females, and that the proximate
end of its behaviour was the possession of one of
them. But if there is one thing that emerges
from the facts more clearly than another it is
that the course of its behaviour was in no way
influenced by the presence or absence of either
of the females. My reasons for saying so are
the following: in the first place, it made no
attempt to pursue or to thrust its attention upon
either one or the other of them; secondly, it
even went so far as to attack and drive them
away when they approached too closely; and in
the third place, when an unpaired female did at
length appear, it adopted a different attitude and
forthwith paired. And bearing in mind that
these two females had already been with their
respective mates for some considerable time, and
that there was reason to believe that coition had
actually taken place, is it likely that any counter-attraction
would have proved successful in
tempting either of them away from its mate, or
probable, if they were the sole attraction, that
the intruding male would have been so persistent
in remaining? How very much simpler it is to
fit the pieces together, if for the time being we
ignore the female and fix our attention upon the
territory. Each item of behaviour then falls
into its proper place, and the fighting which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
seemed so perplexing and meaningless becomes
a factor of prime importance. First of all the
male arrives; then it establishes itself in a small
alder bush and advertises its presence by song;
next, by persistent effort in attacking the
neighbouring males, it frees a piece of ground
from their dominion; and finally, in proper
sequence, a female arrives, pairing takes place,
and reproduction is secured.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f141" id="f141"></a><img src="images/fig141.jpg" width="500" height="792" alt="A battle between
two pairs of Jays." title="A battle between two pairs of Jays." /></div>

<p>How then does the whole matter stand? If
it were males only that engaged in serious
conflict, and if they fought only in the presence
of a female, the problem would resolve itself into
one simply of obtaining mates. But the warfare
extends in a variety of directions, it is not
confined to one sex, nor to unpaired individuals,
nor need the opponents necessarily be of the
same sex; it involves both sexes alike singly or
combined. Now the view that the biological
end of battle is, in its primary aspect, related
to the female, cannot, as we have seen, apply
to the conflicts between different pairs, and
only by much stretching of the imagination
can it be held responsible for the hostility that
males frequently display towards females or <i>vice
versa</i>. It is valid only for a certain form of
warfare. But that form represents, you will say,
a large proportion of the whole, which is true;
and so long as we ignore the remainder, we
might rest content in the belief that we had
solved the major part of the problem. But can
we ignore the remainder? Can we say that the
conflicts between paired males, for example, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
simply offshoots of the pugnacious disposition,
and have no part to play in the process of
reproduction? They recur with marked persistency
season after season and generation after
generation; they are to be found in species
widely remote; they are frequent in occurrence;
and no one who had observed them and noted
the vigour with which they are conducted, could,
I think, conclude that they were meaningless&mdash;and
be satisfied. They must somehow be
explained. So that if anyone thinks fit to
maintain that possession of a mate is an adequate
explanation of part of the hostilities, it is clearly
impossible to regard all the fighting as a
manifestation of one principle directed towards
a common biological end.</p>

<p class="tb">But wherever we extend our researches, we
find that the facts give precision to the view that
the occupation of a territory is the condition
under which the pugnacious instinct is rendered
susceptible to stimulation. The Lapwing, when
in its territory, displays hostility towards other
males of its own species, but when upon neutral
ground, treats them with indifference; the Chiffchaff
pursues its rival up to the boundary and is
then apparently satisfied that its object has been
achieved; the cock Chaffinch in March permits
no other male to intrude upon its acre or so of
ground during the early hours of the morning,
but for the rest of the day it joins the flock
and is sociable; the Herring-Gull resents the
approach of strangers so long as it occupies its
few square feet of cliff, but welcomes companions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
whilst it is following the plough&mdash;all of which
points to a relation between the territory and the
fighting. And this view has at least one merit&mdash;it
accounts for all the fighting no matter what
degree of severity may be reached or in what
way the sexes may be involved. The complexity
of the strife presents no obstacle; for if the
biological end of the fighting is to render the
territory, which has already been established,
secure from intrusion, each sex will have its
allotted part to play at the allotted time: thus
the battles between the males before females
appear on the scene will decide the initial
question of ownership; those between the
females will give an advantage to the more
virile members and insure an even distribution
of mates for the successful males; the constant
struggles between paired males will roughly
maintain the boundaries and prevent such
encroachment as might hamper the supply of
food for the young; and the co-operation of
male and female in defence of the territory will
be an additional safeguard. Each form of battle
will contribute some share towards the main
biological function of reproduction.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have dealt principally with the
male. We have referred, it is true, to the fact
that the female co-operates with her mate in
order to drive away intruders, but beyond this,
we have made no attempt to trace what part, if
any, she plays in the whole scheme. We must
do so now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>The various steps by which the territory is
not only established but made secure from
invasion, imply an inherited nature nicely
balanced in many directions&mdash;first of all the male
must be so attuned as to be ready to search for
a territory at the right moment; then it must
be capable of selecting a suitable environment;
and, having established itself, it must be prepared
to defend its area from a rival, and to resist
encroachment by its neighbours&mdash;and if it failed
in any one of these respects, it would run the
risk of failure in the attainment of reproduction.
Each individual has therefore to pass, so to
speak, through a number of sieves&mdash;the meshes
of which are none too wide&mdash;before it can have
a reasonable prospect of success. This being so,
we ask, in the first place, whether the female,
too, may not have an eliminating test to pass;
and in the second place, whether she may not
also assist in furthering the biological end of
securing the territory.</p>

<p>Now the answer to the first of these
questions will be found to be in the affirmative.
Just as, in the securing of a territory, the ultimate
appeal is to the physical strength of the male,
so, in the course of her search for a mate, the
female may be called upon to challenge, or may
be challenged by a rival, and the issue is decided
by force. My attention was first drawn to this
fact by a struggle between two female Whitethroats,
which I have described elsewhere. The
scene of its occurrence was the corner of a small
osier bed occupied by one male, and the females<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
that took part in it had only recently arrived,
but the male, an unpaired bird, had been in
possession of its territory for some days. The
sequel to this struggle, which was protracted and
severe, was the disappearance of both females,
the male being left without a mate for a further
ten days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f147" id="f147"></a><img src="images/fig147.jpg" width="500" height="932" alt="The female Chaffinch shares in the defence
of the territory and attacks other females." title="The female Chaffinch shares in the defence
of the territory and attacks other females." /></div>

<p>Numerous instances have since come under
my notice. Hen Chaffinches become so absorbed
that they fall to the ground and there continue
the struggle. Seizing hold of one another by
the feathers of the head, they roll from side to
side, and then, without relaxing their grip, lie
exhausted&mdash;the quickened heart-beat, altered
respiration, tightly compressed feathers and
partially expanded wings betraying the intensity
of the conflict.</p>

<p>As the breeding season approaches, hen
Blackbirds grow more pugnacious. Individuals
that early in the year have frequented the same
spot daily and have even shown every sign of
friendship, become openly hostile. For two
years in succession I had an opportunity of
observing females under such conditions, and
of studying the gradual change in their relationship.
Each morning at break of day and for
some hours afterwards they could be seen in the
same place, one following the other as they
searched for food first in this direction and then
in that, as if they derived some special pleasure
from the fact of their companionship. Then a
change began to manifest itself. Indications of
animosity became apparent; one would run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
towards the other in a threatening attitude
and, in a half-hearted manner, peck at it; and
gradually the hostility grew, until the tentative
pecking developed into a scuffle and the scuffle
into a conflict.</p>

<p>Much fighting also occurs between the
females of the Reed-Bunting, and likewise
between those of the Moor-Hen, and because
these two species are not only common but
inhabit respectively open stretches of marshy
ground or large sheets of water, the fighting can
be readily observed.</p>

<p>Why do the females fight before they are
definitely paired? To obtain mates? This
certainly seems to be the obvious explanation
because any question of securing territory can
be excluded; yet if it be true that their sex is
numerically inferior, it is difficult to understand
the necessity for such strenuous competition.
But what is the condition under which the
pugnacious instinct of the female is rendered
susceptible to stimulation? It cannot be merely
the presence of a male ready to breed, for then
there would be endless commotion amongst the
flocks of Chaffinches or of Lapwings which in
March are composed of both sexes, including
even males that have secured territories. There
must be some other circumstance; and, judging
by experience, it is to be found in the territory&mdash;a
male, that is to say, in occupation of one, is
the condition under which the inherited nature
of the female is allowed free play. We must
bear in mind, however, that the competition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
between the males is very severe, that large
numbers probably fail to pass even this preliminary
test, and that only a proportion are in
a position to offer to the female the condition
under which her process can successfully run its
course; so that the presumption is&mdash;though it is
incapable of demonstration&mdash;that there is a competition
for such males each recurring season,
and that, on the average, the weaker females fail
to procreate their kind.</p>

<p>But apart from any direct assistance she may
give in driving away intruders, does she in any
way help to further the biological end of reproduction?
This is a difficult question to answer,
and the suggestion I have to make can only
apply in those cases in which the territory is
occupied throughout the breeding season.
Much of the fighting between the males occurs
in her presence, and it must be admitted&mdash;though
it is difficult to speak with any degree of
certainty&mdash;that such fighting, taken as a whole,
bears the stamp of exceptional determination.
Let us then grant that the excitement of a male
does, under these circumstances, reach a higher
level of intensity, and let us see how this will
add to the security of the territory. The fact
that the male has established itself and obtained
a mate is not alone sufficient to accomplish the
end for which the territory has been evolved.
During the period between the initial discharge
of the sexual function and the time when
incubation draws to a close, much may happen
to prejudice the future of the offspring; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
is always the possibility of invasion by an
individual whose development is backward or
which has been unsuccessful in making good
the first step, and, as we saw in the case of the
Reed-Bunting, a portion of the ground won
may be lost; there is always the danger of
gradual encroachment by neighbouring owners;
and there is even a possibility that a pair may be
so persistently harassed by more virile neighbours
as to forsake the locality permanently. If then
a male is to attain a full measure of success it
must be capable of keeping its boundaries intact
up to the time when the young are able to fend
for themselves, and consequently it is important
that its intolerant nature should remain susceptible
to stimulation throughout the greater part
of the season.</p>

<p>Does the presence of a female serve to
promote this end? Now we know very little of
the influence exerted by one sex upon the other.
Professor Lloyd Morgan has suggested that the
male raises the emotional tone of the female, a
suggestion which seems to me in accordance
with the facts. There is reason to believe, however,
that the converse is also true&mdash;namely that
the excitement of the male reaches a higher level
of intensity when a female is present. Granting
then that his emotional tone is raised, how will
this affect the question? So great is the
difference of opinion as to the part that the
emotions play in furthering the life of the
individual that one hesitates to accept any
particular one. But it seems to be generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
admitted that emotion adds to the efficacy of
behaviour, and this is the view of Professor
Lloyd Morgan. "Whatever may be the exact
psychological nature of the emotions, it may be
regarded," he says, "as certain that they introduce
into the conscious situation elements which
contribute not a little to the energy of behaviour.
They are important conditions to vigorous and
sustained conation." Therefore, if it be true
that the female raises the emotional tone of the
male, the result will be an increased flow of
energy into all the specific modes of behaviour
connected with reproduction, amongst which
those directly concerned in the securing and
defence of the territory will receive their share;
so that instead of a progressive weakening of
just those elements in the situation which make
for success, the level of their efficiency will be
maintained as a result of such reinforcement.
But the female becomes intolerant of her own
sex when she has discovered a male ready to
breed, and, later, assists her mate in resisting
intrusion; and by raising her emotional tone, he
may be the means of furthering more strenuous
behaviour on her part. Each member of the
pair would in this way contribute towards the
energy of behaviour of its mate, and hence add
indirectly to the security of the territory.</p>

<p class="tb">It may be well to illustrate the foregoing
remarks. Suppose that there is a small piece of
woodland barely sufficient to hold three pairs of
Willow-Warblers, and suppose that the male and
female in the middle territory did not respond to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
one another's influence quite as readily as the
adjoining males and females, what would be the
result? The emotional tone of the central pair
would stand at a lower level of intensity; and,
since their congenital dispositions would lack the
necessary reinforcement, the birds would tend
to become less and less punctilious in keeping
their boundaries intact, whereas the adjoining
pairs, always on the alert and meeting with little
opposition, would encroach more and more and
gradually extend their dominion. And so, by
the time the young were hatched, the parents
would be in occupation of an area too limited in
extent to insure the necessarily rapid supply of
food, and would be compelled to intrude upon
the adjoining ground. But knowing how
routine becomes ingrained in the life of the
individual, knowing that for weeks this pair had
submitted to their neighbours, can we believe
that they would be capable of asserting their
authority and that the young would be properly
cared for? Or suppose that different pairs of
Kittiwake Gulls on the crowded ledges, or
different pairs of Puffins in the crowded burrows,
varied in like manner, would they all have
equal chances of rearing their offspring? The
struggle for reproduction is nowhere more severe
than amongst the cliff-breeding sea birds; it is
not for nothing that one sees Kittiwake Gulls,
locked together, fall into the water hundreds of
feet below and struggle to the point of exhaustion,
or, as has been reported, to the point of
death; it is not for nothing that Puffins fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
with such desperation. And surely success will
be attained by that pair whose emotional tone
stands high and whose impulse to fight is therefore
strong, rather than to the ill-assorted couple.</p>

<p>The argument, then, is briefly this. In the
spring, a marked change takes place in the
character of the males of very many species;
instead of being gregarious they either avoid one
another and become hostile, or, if their conditions
of existence require that they shall
still live together, they become irritable and
pugnacious. This change is made known to us
by the battles of varying degrees of severity
which are such a feature of bird life in the
spring; and since a female can commonly be
observed to accompany the combatants, the
possession of a mate appears at first sight to be
the proximate end for which the males are
contending. But when the circumstances which
lead up to the quarrels are investigated closely,
the problem becomes more difficult; for it is
not merely a question of males fighting in the
presence of a female, as is generally supposed to
be the case, but on the contrary there is a complexity
of strife which is bewildering&mdash;males
attack females or <i>vice versa</i>; female fights
with female; or a pair combine to drive
away another pair, or even a solitary individual
no matter of which sex. This complexity of
strife makes against the view that the possession
of a mate is the reason of the fighting. But an
even stronger objection is to be found in the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
that males are hostile when no female is present&mdash;and
hence we must seek elsewhere for the true
explanation.</p>

<p>Now if the behaviour of a male be closely
observed, it will be found that its pugnacious
instinct gains or loses susceptibility according to
the position which it happens to occupy&mdash;when
its ground is trespassed upon, the impulse to
fight is strong; but when it crosses the boundary
it seems to lose all interest in the intruder.
Moreover, in some species, the male rejoins
the flock at intervals during the early part
of the season and for a time leads a double
existence, passing backwards and forwards
between its territory and the neutral ground.
Its behaviour under these circumstances affords
some valuable evidence, for the bird displays
little if any hostility when accompanying the
flock, yet when it returns to the ground over
which it exercises dominion, no male can
approach without being attacked. The conclusion,
therefore, seems to be inevitable, namely
that the actual occupation of a territory is the
condition under which the pugnacious nature of
the male is rendered susceptible to appropriate
stimulation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>THE RELATION OF SONG TO THE TERRITORY</h4>


<p>If we listen to the voices of the Waders as,
in search of food, they follow the slowly ebbing
tide, we shall notice that each species has a
number of different cries, some of which are
uttered frequently and others only occasionally.
Not only so, but if we study the circumstances
under which they are uttered, we shall in time
learn to associate certain specific notes with
certain definite situations.</p>

<p>The Curlew, when surprised, utters a cry
with which most of us, I suppose, are familiar;
but when with lowered head it drives away
another individual from the feeding ground,
it gives expression to its feelings by a low,
raucous sound, which again is different from
its cry when a Common Gull steals the <i>arenicola</i>
that has been drawn out of the mud with such
labour.</p>

<p>Thus we come to speak of "alarm notes,"
"notes of anger," "warning notes"&mdash;naming
each according to the situations which normally
accompany their utterance. And so, all species,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
or at least a large majority of them, have, in
greater or lesser variety, cries and calls which
are peculiar to certain seasons and certain
situations; and since on many occasions we
have indisputable evidence of the utility of
the sound produced&mdash;as when, upon the alarm
being given by one individual, the flock of
Lapwing rises, or when, in response to a
particular note of the parent, the nestling
Blackcap ceases to call&mdash;so are we bound to
infer that all the cries are, in one way or
another, serviceable in furthering the life of
the individual.</p>

<p>But besides these call-notes, birds produce
special sounds during the season of reproduction&mdash;some
by instrument, others by voice,
others again by the aid of mechanical device.
And not only is this the case, but many
accompany their songs with peculiar flights,
such as soaring to a great height, or circling,
or floating in the air upon outstretched wings.
These special sounds and special flights are
those with which I now propose to deal,
including under the heading "song" all sounds
whether harsh or monotonous or beautiful, and
whether vocally or otherwise produced; and I
shall endeavour to show not only that they are
related to the "territory," but that they contribute
not a little to the successful attainment
of reproduction.</p>

<p>The vocal productions are infinite in variety
and combination. At the one extreme we
have songs composed of a single note repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
slowly or rapidly as the case may be, whilst at
the other we have the complex productions
of the Warblers; and between these two
extremes, notes and phrases are combined and
recombined in ways innumerable. And just as
there is a rich variety of combination, so
there is a very wide variation in the purity
and character of the notes&mdash;some are harsh,
others melodious, some flute-like, others more
of a whistle, and others again such as can
only be likened to the notes of a stringed
instrument. Hence in variety of phrase combination
added to variety in the character of
the note, there is a possibility of infinite modes
of expression.</p>

<p>If, in the latter part of May, we take up
a position at dawn in some osier bed, we listen
to songs which have reached a high degree
of specialisation, songs, moreover, which appeal
to us on account of their beauty; if, on the
other hand, we climb down the face of the
sea cliff, we hear an entirely different class of
songs&mdash;harsh, guttural, weird, monotonous
sounds, which, appeal to us though they may,
lack the music of the voices in the osier bed.
And just as, in the osier bed, we can recognise
each species by its voice, so we can distinguish
the "cackle" of the Fulmar, the "croak" of
the Guillemot, or the "grunt" of the Shag.
In the osier bed, however, there is considerable
variation in the song of different individuals
of the same species, so much so that we can
recognise this one from that; whereas on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
cliff we cannot distinguish between the voices
of different individuals. And the more highly
developed the song, the greater the range of
variation appears to be; but notwithstanding
this&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the pitch
may differ, the phrase combination may differ,
and the timbre may differ&mdash;the song remains
nevertheless specific. So that the two principal
features of "song," broadly speaking, are
"diversity" and "specific character."</p>

<p>In contrast with the call-notes, the majority
of which can be heard at all times of the year,
the song is restricted as a rule to one season,
and that one the season of reproduction. It
is true, of course, that some birds sing during
the autumn, and, if the climatic conditions are
favourable, in the winter also, just as others
betray, in the autumn, symptoms of emotional
manifestation peculiar to the spring; but just as
the manifestation of the latter is feeble and
vestigial, so, too, does the song of the former
lack the vigour and persistency which is characteristic
of the spring. Again, in contrast with
the call-notes, which are common alike to both
sexes, song is confined to one sex&mdash;a peculiar
property of the males.</p>

<p>Now all, I think, will agree that it must
serve some biological purpose&mdash;this at least
seems to be the conclusion to be drawn from the
two outstanding features of "diversity" and
"specific character"; and since the voices of
different individuals of the same species vary, it
has been suggested that, by creating a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
effective pairing situation, it is serviceable in
furthering the life of the individual. I do not
propose at the moment to enquire whether this
doctrine be true, but rather to direct attention
to other ways in which the song may be
useful.</p>

<p>Is the instinct susceptible to stimulation
under all conditions during the season of reproduction,
or only under some well-defined
condition? This is the question to which we
will first direct inquiry.</p>

<p>Song in its full development belongs, as we
have seen, to the season of reproduction; it is
heard at the dawn of the seasonal sexual process,
and is the most conspicuous outward manifestation
of the internal organic changes which
ultimately lead to reproduction. These changes
would appear, at first sight, to be the primary
condition which renders the instinct susceptible
to appropriate stimulation. But while this is
true up to a point, in so far, that is to say, as
organic changes are a necessary antecedent of
all behaviour connected with the attainment
of reproduction, closer acquaintance with the
circumstances under which the instinct is allowed
full play leads to the belief that they are not
alone sufficient to account for the facts as
observed. In order to arrive at a decision we
must seek out the specific factors in the external
environment with which "song" is definitely
related.</p>

<p>Some birds cross whole continents on their
way to the breeding grounds, others travel many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
miles, others again find suitable accommodation
in a neighbouring parish&mdash;nearly all have a
journey to perform, it may be short or it may be
long. The flocks of Finches gradually decrease
and we observe the males scattering in different
directions in search of territories; we watch the
summer migrants on their way&mdash;small parties
halting for a few hours in the hedgerows and
then continuing their journey, single individuals
alighting on trees and bushes and resting there
for a few minutes, and the constant passage of
flocks of various dimensions at various altitudes;
and we see Fieldfares, Redwings, and Bramblings
slowly making their way from the south and
the west to their homes in the far north.
Occasionally we hear their song, not the
emotional outburst customary at this season,
but, except in isolated cases, a weak and tentative
performance. G&auml;tke speaks of the absence
of song on the Island of Heligoland, and refers
to the Whitethroat as one of the few migrants
that enliven that desolate rock with their melody.
On the other hand, many migrants that rest
temporarily on the Isle of May sing vigorously.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
But on the whole there is, I think, no question
that the male whilst travelling to its breeding
grounds, and, even after its arrival, whilst in
search of a territory, sings but little&mdash;and that
little lacks the persistency characteristic of
the period of sexual activity. Yet, when a
suitable territory is eventually secured, the
nature of the bird seems to change; for, instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of being silent and retiring, as if aware of some
end not fully attained, it not only makes itself
conspicuous but advertises its presence by a
song uttered with such perseverance as to
suggest that that end is at length attained.
Hence, in a general way, the instinct of song
seems to be related to the establishment of a
territory.</p>

<p>Now the subsequent course of behaviour
tends to confirm this view. We have already
had occasion to refer to the fact that the males
of some species desert their territories temporarily
and join together on ground which is regarded
by the birds that associate there as neutral, and
that they do so not merely for the purpose of
securing food but because they derive some
special pleasure from the act of association, and
we shall find that the altered behaviour of the
male when it leaves its territory to seek food or
to join the flock is an important point for us
just now.</p>

<p>Buntings desert their territories temporarily
and collect in flocks on the newly sown fields of
grain. Some of the males are single, others are
paired, and accompanied, it may be, by their
mates; they wander over the ground in search
of food, uttering their call-notes from time to
time, or, settling upon the hedges and trees
surrounding the field, rest there and preen their
feathers. But even though a male may be
surrounded by other males, even though it may
occupy a position where it is conspicuous to all
around, even though, that is to say, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
apparently in contact with just those stimulating
circumstances which will evoke a response when
it returns to its territory, yet it makes no attempt
to sing.</p>

<p>Lapwings, when they resort to the neutral
ground, run this way and that in full enjoyment
of one another's companionship, behaving
as they do when they flock in autumn
and winter. Specific emotional manifestation
is, however, absent, and their actions seem to
be in nowise affected by the powerful impulse
which only a few minutes previously determined
their conduct, for of the characteristic
flight with its accompanying cry there is no
sign.</p>

<p>Early in the season Turtle Doves often
collect from the surrounding country at certain
spots where their favourite food is abundant.
The croak of this Dove&mdash;its true song&mdash;is a
familiar sound during the summer, but in
addition the bird has a sexual note characteristic
of the race. I watched a flock of upwards of
one hundred on some derelict ground approximately
eight acres in extent. Here, in May,
the birds were attracted by the seeds of <i>Stellaria
media</i> which was growing in profusion. After
5 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> there was continuous traffic between this
piece of ground and the surrounding neighbourhood,
a constant arrival and departure of single
individuals or pairs; and, as they fed, the sexual
note could be heard in all directions. Now some
of the males occupied territories close at hand,
and one could watch their passage to and fro;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
yet in no single instance did I hear the true song
uttered on the feeding ground, although the
moment a male returned to its territory its
monotonous croak could be heard, uttered moreover
with that persistence which is so marked
a feature of all song or of the sounds that
correspond to it.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that, even after the
internal organic changes have taken place,
the instinct of song is not susceptible to
stimulation at all times and under all circumstances,
but only at certain specified times
and under special circumstances which can be
observed to correspond with the occupation of
the territory.</p>

<p>In many species each male singles out
within its territory some prominent position
to which it resorts with growing frequency.
This position is an important feature of the
territory, and exercises a dominating influence
on the life of the bird. I have referred to it
as the "headquarters," and it may be a solitary
tree or bush, an outstanding mound or
mole hillock, a gatepost or a railing&mdash;anything
in fact that supplies a convenient
resting place so long as it fulfils one condition,
namely that the bird when it is there is conspicuous.
It need not, however, be a tree or a
mound or indeed anything upon which the
bird can perch, for there is reason to think
that the soaring flight undertaken at this
season by so many males, since it is generally
accompanied by the specific sexual sound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
answers the same purpose as the topmost branch
of a tree.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing in the external
environment to which the song is more
definitely related than to the "headquarters"&mdash;this
at least is the conclusion to be drawn from
the behaviour, and I will indicate the sort of
evidence upon which such conclusion is based.
There is, first of all, the persistency with which
the male resorts to the same tree, even to the
same branch, and, as it seems, solely for the
purpose of advertisement. We know by
experience the approximate routine of the
male's behaviour; we know where to seek it,
where to hear it, and when once we have
discovered its headquarters, we know that there
it will sing day after day for weeks or it may
be for months together&mdash;perhaps the most
striking feature of its behaviour at this season.
Next, we find that other trees, though made use
of, are not made use of to a similar extent for
the purpose of song. The area occupied varies
much according to the nature of the environment;
it is sometimes extensive, and seldom less
than half an acre or so in extent; but in most
instances it contains plenty of trees and bushes
which could, one would imagine, serve the
purpose of a "headquarters" just as well as the
particular one selected, and yet the bird, when
there, betrays no inclination to sing at all comparable
with that which can be observed when
it occupies its accustomed perch. Further
evidence is afforded in the behaviour of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
species that make temporary excursions from
their territories. The male, on its return, flies
as a rule direct to its special tree and sings.
Sometimes, however, it settles upon the ground,
not unfrequently accompanied by the female,
and while there remains silent; but presently
rising from the ground and deserting its mate,
it flies to the headquarters and sings. Again,
nearly every male at one time or another in the
course of the season is aroused to action by the
intrusion of a rival. The emotional tone of the
owner of the territory is then raised, and the
intruder is pursued and attacked; but this alone
is not sufficient, it seems as if the chain of
instinctive activities, when once aroused by
appropriate stimulation, must pursue its course
to the end&mdash;and the end in such a case is only
reached and complete satisfaction only gained
when the bird has not merely returned to his
"headquarters" but has given vocal expression
to his emotion. Finally, we must bear in mind
these two facts, that the "headquarters" is
occupied solely by the male&mdash;it forms no part of
the life of the female&mdash;and that it is the male
only that sings.</p>

<p>Many such subtle incidents of behaviour as
the foregoing can be perceived but not readily
described, and trifling though they may seem
to be in themselves, yet in the aggregate they
yield full assurance of a close relationship.</p>

<p>The distant song of a male, or the presence
of an intruding male, have also stimulating
effects, though in somewhat different ways.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
The former evokes the normal reply, that is to
say the bird, if silent, is liable to utter a corresponding
reply; the latter arouses hostility into
which is infused much feeling tone, the bird
sings hurriedly while in pursuit of its rival,
and, which is more remarkable still, even in the
midst of an encounter. Both the normal reply
and the emotional song must be similar in
origin&mdash;different aspects of the same situation&mdash;and
both are clearly related to the other
male.</p>

<p>The arrival of a female may also be followed
by an emotional outburst which can be heard
at intervals for some days; on the other hand,
the song may continue as before or, for a time,
entirely cease.</p>

<p>To take the emotional outburst first. This
would appear to be susceptible of explanation
on the hypothesis that the voice contributes to
a more effective pairing situation; an hypothesis
which admittedly, at first sight, gains some
support from the fact that a second or a third
male is frequently present. But, in truth, the
presence of a second male makes the situation,
so far as the relationship between the song and
the female is concerned, all the more perplexing;
for, as we have already seen, the instinct of
pugnacity, when aroused by the appearance of
an intruder, is also liable to be accompanied by
a similarly extravagant song. On each occasion
the vocal effort is infused with much feeling
tone, and it would be impossible to point to
any one feature which is peculiar to only one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
occasion. The question therefore arises as to
whether the emotional outburst which we are
attributing to the arrival of a female may not
after all be due to the presence of an intruding
male. It may be so. But although I can recall
no single instance in which the presence of an
intruder could be definitely excluded, yet I
should hesitate to base upon this any broad
generalisation.</p>

<p>When the normal course of the song is not
interrupted by the arrival of a female, when,
that is to say, the male still pursues the routine
to which he has all along been accustomed,
and still sings at stated intervals in stated
places with a voice that betrays no heightened
emotional tone, even though the song may
convey some meaning to the delicate perceptual
powers of the female, we have nothing to lay
hold upon which can be construed as an indication
of direct relationship between the song
and the presence of the female.</p>

<p>The partial or complete suspension of the
song after pairing has taken place is the most
interesting, as it is the most noticeable, feature.
Not that it is by any means universal&mdash;if it
were so, some of the difficulties that beset the
path of interpretation would be removed, but
it is sufficiently widespread to demand explanation.
In nearly every case it is, however,
only temporary, the period during which the
male is silent varying from a few days to a
few weeks. The male Grasshopper-Warbler,
when it first reaches us, sings persistently, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
when it is joined by a female a change becomes
apparent; instead of the incessant trill, there
are spasmodic outbursts of short duration, and
in the course of a few days the bird lapses into
a silence which may be broken for a short while
at dawn, or late in the evening, but is often
complete. More striking still is the change in
the case of the Marsh-Warbler, and the sudden
deterioration, or even suspension, of strains so
beautiful and so varied, at a moment, too, when
it might least be expected, at once arrests the
attention. The Reed-Warbler that had its
headquarters in a willow sang vigorously from
the middle of May until a female arrived on
the 20th June, when its voice was hushed, except
for occasional outbursts which lacked force
and were of short duration. When the Wood-Warbler
secures a territory it repeats its sibilant
trill with unwearying zeal, yet no sooner does
a mate appear than its emotion is manifested
in other directions. The Reed-Bunting is
vociferous during February and March; but
when a female arrives, periods of silence are
frequent and the instinct of the bird becomes
progressively less susceptible to stimulation.
After the manner of the race the male makes
temporary excursions from its territory accompanied
by his mate, and it is noteworthy that
when he returns and she is absent he sings,
but that the moment she joins him, or even
comes into sight, he is silent. In fact, in greater
or less degree, a change is noticeable in the
song of many resident and migratory species<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
under similar circumstances, a deterioration so
marked that we learn by experience to regard
it as a certain indication of the arrival of a
mate.</p>

<p>Thus it becomes clear that there are certain
specific factors in the external environment with
which the instinct can be definitely related,
and in the order of their importance they are
(1) the territory as a whole; (2) the headquarters;
(3) an intruding male; (4) the female.</p>

<p>To what extent are these relationships interrelated?
Are they all mutually dependent upon
one another, or is there one which conditions the
remainder?</p>

<p>In the first place it is evident that if a male
were not to establish a territory, no opportunity
would be afforded for making use of any special
post or for acquiring a habit in relation to it,
and so without further consideration we may
say that the connection between the song and
the headquarters, whatever it may be, is
primarily dependent upon the establishment of
a territory.</p>

<p>Next, we have the fact that the distant voice,
or still more so the presence, of another male
has an exciting influence and evokes a corresponding
reply. Here we have a direct relationship,
and one which at first sight appears to
be exclusive of cross-correlation. But is it really
so; does no circumstance arise under which even
the proximity of a rival fails to evoke response?
The reply is not doubtful. Such a circumstance
<i>does</i> arise&mdash;when a male for one reason or another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
passes outside the limits of its accustomed area.
This aspect of behaviour has already been fully
discussed in connection with the question of
hostility, and everyone, I imagine, must by
now be pretty well familiar with the facts.
However, it does not often happen that we
are given such an aid to interpretation as is
vouchsafed to us in the altered behaviour of
the male when it joins the flock, and if, as
I believe, song and hostility are intimately
associated, forming part of an inter-related
whole which, for biological interpretation, has,
as its end, the attainment of reproduction, it
is not surprising that circumstances which lead
to the modification of the one should likewise
affect the other; I offer no apology, therefore,
for adverting to this aspect of behaviour once
again.</p>

<p>Now a male may leave its territory for three
reasons&mdash;to pursue an intruder, to join the flock
on neutral ground, or to find the necessary means
of subsistence on other feeding grounds. On
each of these occasions it hears the song of, and
is in close contact with, other males; and if the
relationship of which we are speaking be really
exclusive of cross-correlation, its instinct ought
to respond with the customary freedom. But
what happens? A male pursues its rival,
betraying much emotion and singing extravagantly,
until the boundary is passed, when
emotion subsides and it is silent; or, it flies to
the flock on neutral ground, and, although
surrounded by the very males that a short time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
previously evoked response, is there unresponsive;
or again, it goes in search of food and collects
with other males bent on a similar errand, and
in presence of what we know would be an
exciting influence under other circumstances,
it nevertheless remains silent. Hence the
relationship between the song and a male rival
seems, as in the case of the headquarters, to
depend in the first instance upon the occupation
of a territory.</p>

<p>So that the relationship between the song
and the territory as a whole is clearly of a
different order from that which obtains between
the song and the headquarters, or the song and a
male rival; for the first, as far as can be judged
by observation, is exclusive of, whilst the second
and the third involve, cross-correlation. How
are these facts to be explained? We have
already seen that it belongs to the nature of the
male during the season of reproduction to
establish itself in a definite place, and this action
is just as much a part of its hereditary nature as
the building of the nest is of that of the female,
and it is just as necessary for the successful
attainment of reproduction. What exactly the
stimulus is to this mode of behaviour we do
not know; we can go no further back than
the internal organic changes which are known
to occur and which we assume, not without
some reason, are responsible for its initiation.
Granting, then, that there is this congenital
disposition, what relation does it bear to the
song? Without a doubt the song is likewise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
founded upon a congenital basis; it is truly
instinctive, and as such requires appropriate
stimulation; furthermore the male sings only
when in occupation of its territory. Having
regard to these two facts we might say that
the territory is the stimulus to the song. But
this can scarcely be a true interpretation, for
inasmuch as the stimulus would be relatively
constant, a relatively constant response ought to
follow, and even a slight acquaintance with the
daily round of behaviour will furnish plenty of
evidence to the contrary, seeing that the song,
though persistent, is never continuous&mdash;in fact
there are long periods of silence during the
daytime, and only in the morning and the
evening does the male become really vociferous.
What then is the stimulus? Through awareness
of something in the environment the male
responds to stimulation, and the only reply we
can give is that the headquarters, or a distant
song, or the proximity of another male&mdash;with
all of which, as we have seen, the instinct is
definitely related&mdash;are the specific factors which
normally evoke response&mdash;and experience teaches
us that the periods of quiescence are just those
when life is at its lowest ebb and these stimulating
factors less in evidence. Bearing this in
mind, bearing in mind the fact that when a male
joins the flock or crosses the boundary its
instinct ceases to respond, bearing in mind,
that is to say, that there is evidence of relationship
between these specific factors and the
song only when the territory is actually occu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>pied,
the conclusion seems inevitable that we
have here the determining condition which
renders the instinct susceptible to appropriate
stimulation.</p>

<p>There remains the female. I place her last
in order of importance, not because I regard her
influence as of small consequence, but because
the evidence is of a varied and complex kind,
so much so that it is difficult to ascertain by
observation just how far she is a situational item.
It will be remembered that the only direct
evidence we had of such influence was a
deterioration or, in some instances, a complete
cessation of vocal manifestation. Clearly then
we are confronted with a relationship of a
different kind from that which we have been
discussing; for not only is anything in the
nature of stimulation absent, but, and this is a
remarkable fact, the other items in the environment
which formerly evoked response no longer
do so in quite the same way. Is there any
awareness on the part of the male of the relation
between his voice and the mate that is to be, or
is it merely that as the sexual situation increases
in complexity some inhibiting influence comes
into play? These are questions which lead up
to difficult problems. But it is no part of my
task to discuss the psychological aspect of the
behaviour; my purpose is merely to show that
the situation on the arrival of a female undergoes
marked modification, that the instinct of the
male is then less susceptible to stimulation, and
that the factors in the external environment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
which formerly elicited response become relatively
neutral.</p>

<p>Hence the appearance of the female on the
scene marks the opening of a new stage in the
life-history of the male, and, to judge by the
course of events, it would seem as if the song
with its network of relationships had now served
its main biological purpose.</p>

<p>And now, what is the purpose, and what the
origin, of song? Is it, as some naturalists have
conceived, a means of raising the emotional tone
of the female, of creating a more effective pairing
situation, and so of removing a barrier to the
successful discharge of the sexual function; or,
is the emphasis here too much upon the
emotional, too little upon the strictly utilitarian,
aspect? All, I think, will agree that it must
serve some biological purpose, and the position
we have so far reached is that the determining
condition of its manifestation is not merely the
establishment, but the actual occupation of a
territory, and that there are no factors in the
external environment which can evoke response
in the absence of such condition. This being so,
the further questions arise as to whether it
contributes towards the attainment of the end
for which the whole territorial system has been
built up, and what precisely is the way in which
it does so.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that in the spring the
shyest of birds no longer practise the art of
concealment. The Curlew soars to a great
height, and upon outstretched wings hovers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the air whilst uttering its plaintive wail; the
cock Grouse, as if dissatisfied with its "crowing,"
springs into the air and becomes a conspicuous
object of the moor; the wary Redshank, poised
on flickering wings, forgets its mournful alarm
cry, and finds again its melodious song; and
even the secretive Grasshopper-Warbler crawls
out of the midst of the thicket in order to "reel,"
just as, for a similar reason, Savi's Warbler
climbs to the top of a tall reed. In fact the
males of most species, when they are finally
established on the breeding grounds, make
themselves as conspicuous as possible by sight
and by sound. And since the sounds produced
by no two species are exactly alike, the females
are able to recognise their prospective mates,
and the males that are still in search of ground
have ample warning if that upon which they are
treading is already occupied. So that you see,
from the remarkable development of the vocal
powers in the male, there follow two important
results&mdash;"recognition" and "warning."</p>

<p>We here turn from song as the expression of
an instinctive disposition, and the question of
what calls forth this expression, to the impression
produced by the song on the hearer.</p>

<p>Most birds have a call-note or a number of
call-notes, which, generally speaking, are specifically
distinct. But to the human ear they are not
always so, perhaps because our power of hearing
is less sensitive than that of a bird, and unable to
appreciate delicate differences of tone. Be this
as it may, however, the fact remains that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
often find it difficult, and in not a few cases
impossible, to recognise a bird merely by its call.
The plaintive notes of the Willow-Warbler and
of the Chiffchaff are to our ears very closely
akin, so, too, are those of the Marsh-Warbler
and of the Reed-Warbler, and there is a great
resemblance between the hissing sound produced
by the two Whitethroats. In Co. Donegal I
have been deceived by the spring-call of the
Chaffinch which, owing possibly to the humidity
of the atmosphere, is, there, almost indistinguishable
from the corresponding note of the
Greenfinch. The Yellow Bunting and the Cirl
Bunting frequently make use of a similar note,
so do the Curlew and the Whimbrel. In fact,
numberless instances could be quoted in which
notes appear to us identical, and, as a rule, the
more closely related the species, the more difficult
it becomes to distinguish the sounds&mdash;alike in
plumage, alike in behaviour, alike in emotional
manifestation, it would be surprising if they were
not alike in voice. But the moment we pass
from the call-notes to a consideration of the
songs we are faced with a very remarkable fact,
for not only are these readily distinguished, but
in many cases they bear no resemblance in any
single characteristic. What could be more unlike
than the songs of the Willow-Warbler and of
the Chiffchaff, of the Marsh-Warbler and the
Reed-Warbler, or of the Yellow Bunting and
the Cirl Bunting?</p>

<p>Now when different individuals collect in
flocks at certain seasons, they assist one another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in finding food, and afford mutual protection by
giving timely warning of the approach of a
common enemy, and the gregarious instinct is
thus of great advantage to the species; but no
matter how powerful the impulse to flock might
be, if there were no adequate means of communication,
the different units would frequently
fail to discover their neighbours. Here the
specific cries and calls come into play, enabling
them as they move about in search of food, or
change their feeding grounds, or whilst they are
on migration, to keep constantly in touch with
one another; and hence one purpose that these
call-notes serve is that of recognition. Moreover,
they convey their meaning to individuals of other
species and are acted upon, and are thus in every
sense socially serviceable; but on the other hand,
whilst there is much evidence to show that the
song is of great individual value, there is none
to show that it is in any like manner of direct
advantage to the community.</p>

<p>If, then, there is in the call-notes an adequate
means of communication and of recognition, why
do I suggest that the song has also been evolved
primarily for the purpose of recognition?</p>

<p>What, first of all, are the conditions in the
life behaviour during the season of reproduction
that make the intervention of the voice a consideration
of such importance? The general
result of our investigation might be summed up
thus: we found that the male inherits a disposition
to secure a territory, that at the proper
season this disposition comes into functional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
activity and leads to its establishment in a
definite place, and that it cannot search for a
mate because its freedom of action in this respect
is forbidden by law; that the female inherits no
such disposition, that she is free to move from
place to place, free to satisfy her predominant
inclination, and to seek a mate where she wills;
and, since the appropriate organic condition
which leads to pairing must coincide with
appropriate conditions in the environment, that
the union of the sexes must be accomplished
without undue delay. Furthermore we found
that a territory is essential if the offspring are to
be successfully reared; that, since the available
breeding ground is limited, competition for it is
severe, and that the male is precluded from
leaving the ground which he has selected, and
is obliged, in order to secure a mate, to make
himself conspicuous. That was our general
result. Now there are two ways by which the
male can make himself conspicuous&mdash;by occupying
such a position that he can be readily seen, or
by producing some special sound which will be
audible to the female and direct her to the spot.
The former, by itself, is insufficient; in the dim
light of the early dawn, when life is at its highest,
and mating proceeds apace, what aid would it be
for a male to perch on the topmost branch of a
tree, how slender a guide in the depth of the
forest? But whether in the twilight or in the
dark, in the thicket or the jungle, on the mountain
or on the moor, the voice can always be
heard&mdash;and the voice is the principal medium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
through which the sexes are brought into
contact.</p>

<p>Well now, we come back to the question,
why, if all species have a serviceable recognition
call, that call should not be sufficient for the
purpose, just as, without a doubt, it is adequate
for all purposes at other seasons? The answer
is, I think, clear. The recognition call is not
confined to one sex, nor only to breeding birds;
it is the common property of all the individuals
of the species, and if the female were to rely
upon it as a guide she might at one moment
pursue another female, at another a non-breeding
male; she might even be guided to a
paired female or to a paired male, and time
would be wasted and much confusion arise. So
that no matter how much a male might advertise
himself by cries and calls which were common
alike to all the individuals of the species, it
would not assist the biological end which we
have in view. Something else is therefore
required to meet the peculiar circumstances,
some special sound bearing a definite meaning
by which the female can recognise, amongst the
host of individuals of no consequence to her,
just those particular males in a position to breed
and ready to receive mates. Hence the vocal
powers, the power of producing sounds instrumentally,
and the power of flight, have been
organised to subserve the biological end of
"recognition."</p>

<p>And this view is strengthened, it seems to
me, by the erratic behaviour of certain species,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
more particularly by one remarkable case, the
case of the Cuckoo. The male, after having
established himself, utters his call persistently
from the day of arrival until approximately the
middle of June; but, in contrast with the
large majority of species, the female has a
characteristic call which she, too, utters at
frequent intervals. The female is polyandrous
and has a sphere of influence embracing the
territories of a number of males; she wanders
from place to place, is often silent, and not
unfrequently is engaged in dealing with her egg
or in searching for a nest in which to deposit it,
and therefore she is not always in touch with a
male, still less with any particular one. Now
there is much evidence to show that the
discharge of the sexual function amongst birds
is subject to control, and that this control
operates through the female&mdash;through her
physiological state becoming susceptible to
stimulation only at certain periods. So that we
have these considerations, that the female is
polyandrous, that she has a territory distinct
from that of the male, and that her sexual
impulse is periodical; and the further consideration
that the impulse, since it is periodical, is of
limited duration and must receive immediate
satisfaction. Such being the circumstances of
the case, would the voice of the male serve to
insure the union of the sexes at the appropriate
moment? Well, the fact that she is polyandrous
implies that every male in her sphere of
influence is not always capable of satisfying her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
sexual instinct. Is, then, the male's call an
indication of his readiness to yield to stimulation?
Without a doubt it is an index of the
general physiological state which generates the
sexual impulse, without a doubt it denotes a
general preparedness to breed, but there is no
evidence to show that it denotes the degree of
ardour of the male at any particular moment,
and much that proves the contrary. So that
only by the female producing some special
sound which will attract the males that are
eager and bring them rapidly to the spot where
she happens to be, only thus is it possible to
insure the consummation of the sexual act.
This, it seems to me, is the purpose of the
peculiar call of the female&mdash;a call which, so far
as biological interpretation is concerned, is just
as much a song as the melody of the Marsh-Warbler&mdash;and
its interest for us just now lies in
this, that here we have a special case in which
the sexes have separate territories, the female is
polyandrous, and the voice of the male is not
sufficient by itself to bring to pass the union
of the sexes; and in which, consequently, if
the purpose of song be that of recognition,
we should expect to find, as we do find, that
the female had a distinct and penetrating
call.</p>

<p>We now come to the question of "warning,"
by no means the least important purpose of
song. I pointed out that one of the chief
differences between the call-notes and the song
was that the former were socially serviceable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
whereas the latter was only serviceable to
certain individuals; and in making this statement,
I had in mind the direct benefits to the
community which proceeded from an appreciation
of sounds having a mutually beneficial
meaning, not the indirect, though none the less
beneficial, consequences to the species as a
whole. Biologically considered, song, if it acts
as a warning and thereby leads in one way or
another to more complete success in the rearing
of offspring, may be spoken of as socially
serviceable; but it is legitimate to draw a
distinction between the prospective value of
remote relationships which we can foresee,
and the mutual assistance which the individuals
of a community derive from their close
association.</p>

<p>If there were always sufficient breeding
ground to support the offspring of all the
individuals of each species, if the individuals
were always so distributed that there was no
possibility of overcrowding in any particular
area, and if the conditions of existence of
different species were so widely divergent that
the presence of this one in no way affected the
interests of that, no opportunity would be
afforded for the development of so complex a
system as is involved in the "territory" and all
that appertains to it. But the available breeding
ground is by no means unlimited. The
supply of food, which is a determining factor
in the environment, is always fluctuating according
to the climate and according to the changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
in the earth's surface; and so the distribution of
the bird population in any given area, though it
may be suitably adjusted for one year or even
for a period of years, is bound in the course of
time to require readjustment. Now there
cannot be readjustment without competition,
nor competition without combat. But the
appeal to physical force is only a means to an
end, and, since no male can endure incessant
warfare and the perpetual strain of always being
on the alert, without experiencing such physical
exhaustion as might affect his power of reproduction,
its direct effect upon the combatants
cannot be otherwise than harmful&mdash;in fact it is
a necessary evil which for the good of the
species must be kept strictly within bounds.
Bearing in mind, then, these two facts, namely
that the distribution of the males is never stable
and that overmuch fighting may defeat the end
in view, we can appreciate the importance of
any factor which will lead to a more uniform
distribution and at the same time insure security
by peaceable means.</p>

<p>The proximate end of the male's behaviour is
isolation&mdash;how is it to be obtained? If, after
having occupied a territory, the bird were to
remain silent, it would run the risk of being
approached by rivals; if, on the other hand, it
were merely to utter the recognition call of the
species, it would but attract them. In neither
case would the end in view be furthered, and
isolation would solely depend upon alertness and
the capacity to eject intruders. Supposing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
however, that the song, just as it serves to
attract the females, serves to repel other males,
a new element is introduced deserving of recognition;
for those males that had established
themselves would not only be spared the
necessity of many a conflict, but they would be
spared also the necessity of constant watchfulness,
and so, being free to pursue their normal routine&mdash;to
seek food, to rest, and, if migrants, to
recover from the fatigue of the journey, they
would be better fitted to withstand the strain of
reproduction; and those that were still seeking
isolation in an appropriate environment, instead
of settling first here and then there only to find
themselves forestalled, would avoid and pass by
positions that were occupied, establishing themselves
without loss of time in those that were
vacant. Without the aid of something beyond
mere physical encounter to regulate dispersal,
it is difficult to imagine how in the
short time at disposal anything approaching
uniformity of distribution could be obtained.
Hence, both in the direction of limiting combat,
of insuring accommodation for the maximum
number of pairs in the minimum area, and of
conserving energy, the song, by conveying a
warning, plays an important part in the whole
scheme.</p>

<p>And if this be so, if the song repels instead
of attracting, it follows that the more distinct
the sounds, the less likelihood will there be of
confusion; for supposing that different species
were to develop similar songs, whole areas might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
be left without their complement of pairs just
because this male mistook the voice of that,
and avoided it when there was no necessity for
doing so. So that just as from the point of
view of "recognition" each female must be able
to distinguish the voice of its own kind, so
likewise the warning can only be adequate
providing that the sounds are specifically distinct.
A point, however, arises here in regard to
closely related forms. Some species require
similar food and live under similar conditions of
existence; they meet in competition and fight
with one another; and, if they did not do so, the
food-supply of a given area would be inadequate
to support the offspring of all the pairs inhabiting
that area. Generally speaking, the more closely
related the forms happen to be, the more severe
the competition tends to become; and it may be
argued that in such cases a similar song would
contribute to more effective distribution and in
some measure provide against the necessity of
physical encounter; that, in fact, it would stand
in like relation to the success of all the
individuals concerned, as does the song to the
individuals of the same species. But we must
bear in mind that the primary purpose of song
is to direct the females to those males that
are in a position to breed; and to risk the
possibility of prompt recognition in order that
the males of closely related species should fight
the less, would be to sacrifice that which is
indispensable for a more remote and less
important advantage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>What meaning does the song convey to a
male that is unestablished? Does the bird
recognise that it is forestalled; does it foresee
and fear the possibility of a conflict, and
conclude that the attempt to settle is not worth
while? I do not imagine that it thinks about it
at all. How then does the warning warn?
We will endeavour to answer this question, but,
in order to do so, we must review the stages by
which a territory is secured.</p>

<p>We take as our starting point the internal
organic changes which are known to occur.
These changes are correlated with other changes,
manifested by a conspicuous alteration in
behaviour&mdash;to wit, the disappearance of sociability
and its replacement by isolation. Having
found a station which meets the requirements of
its racial characteristics, the male establishes
itself for a season, becomes vociferous, displays
hostility towards others of its kind, and in due
course is discovered by a female. The whole is
thus an inter-related whole, a chain of activities
which follow one another in ordered sequence.
Now we have seen that it is neither pugnacious
nor vociferous until the territory is actually
occupied; we have seen that the fact of occupation
is the condition under which the instincts of
pugnacity and of song are rendered susceptible
to appropriate stimulation; we have discussed
the nature of the stimulus in each case, and we
wish to know the sort of meaning that the song
conveys to an individual which is still in the
preliminary stage of seeking a station. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
sequential order we have the following: (1)
internal organic changes which lead to isolation,
(2) the appropriate environment which gives rise
to an impulse to remain in it, (3) the occupation
of a territory which is the condition under which
the instincts are rendered susceptible to stimulation,
(4) the various stimuli. Each is dependent
upon that which precedes it, and no part can be
subtracted without failure of the biological end
in view, neither can the different stages be
combined in different order. So that, in
considering the significance of song to an
unestablished male, we are dealing with the
situation at a point at which all the latent
activities have not been fully felt, for all that so
far has occurred is the change from sociability to
isolation determined by internal organic changes.
The bird has not established a territory because
it has not come into contact with the appropriate
environment, and it is not pugnacious because
the condition which renders its instinct susceptible
is absent; and so, as it wanders from place
to place and hears the voices of males here or
males there, it merely behaves in accordance
with that part of its nature which predominates
just at that particular moment&mdash;the impulse to
avoid them.</p>

<p>But given the appropriate environment,
given, that is to say, just that combination of
circumstances which might bring into functional
activity all the latent instincts of the intruder,
and no matter how vociferous the occupant of
a territory might be, it would not be preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
from molestation. The advantage of the song,
biologically considered, is then this, that it will
often prove just sufficient to preclude males
in search of isolation from coming into contact
with the environmental conditions adequate to
supply the stimulus to their latent activities
and to convert them into rivals.</p>

<p>If this interpretation be correct, if we are
right in attributing the withdrawal solely to
the fact that the first stage only in the relational
series has been reached, it follows that the
effect of song upon males that have reached
subsequent stages in that series must be of a
very different kind. We have dealt with the
male when in the preliminary stage of seeking
isolation, we must deal with it now when
eventually it occupies a territory. How does
it behave when it hears, as it is bound to do,
the voices of rivals in its neighbourhood? You
may remember that some allusion was made
to the fact that an outburst of song from one
individual was followed, not unfrequently, by a
similar outburst on the part of other individuals
in the immediate locality. For example, silence
may reign in the reed-bed except for an occasional
note of the Reed-Warbler or Sedge-Warbler.
Suddenly, however, a dispute arises between two
individuals, accompanied by a violent outburst
of song, and forthwith other males in the
vicinity begin to sing excitedly and continue
doing so for some minutes in a strangely
vigorous manner, the tumult of voices affording
a striking contrast to the previous silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Spasmodic outbursts of this kind, stimulated
by an isolated utterance, are by no means
uncommon. But not only does song stimulate
song; under certain conditions it has the still
more remarkable effect of arousing hostility.
The boundary that separates two adjoining
territories is by no means a definite line, but
rather a fluid area wandered over by this
owner at one moment, by that at another.
Now so long as the bird is silent while in this
area, the probability is that it will escape
detection and remain unmolested; let it however
sing&mdash;it often does so&mdash;and it will not merely
be approached but attacked, and consequently
this area is the scene of much strife. The point
to be noticed here is that the song brings about
no withdrawal; it elicits a response, attracts
instead of repelling, and, in short, arouses the
impulse that is always predominant in the
nature of the male when eventually it occupies
a territory&mdash;the impulse of self-assertiveness.
Therefore it seems clear that the different stages
in the process of reproduction mark the appearance
of different conditions, each of which
renders some new impulse susceptible to
stimulation, and that the significance of song
depends upon the stage which happens to
have been reached. Hence when we speak
of song acting as a "warning," we do not
mean that it arouses any sensation of fear; it
is but a stimulus to that part of the inherited
nature of the hearer which predominates at the
moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>Are we then justified in the use of such
terms as "warning," "significance," or even
"meaning," when it is but a matter of stimulus
and response? In what does the impulse to
avoid other males consist? There is no reason
to suppose that there is any sensation of fear
in the first stage, and the course of behaviour
demonstrates that there is none in the later
stages. But it is difficult to conceive of an
impulse which has, as its end, the isolation
of the individual from members of its own
sex and kind, without some feeling-tone, the
reverse of pleasurable, entering into the situation;
just as it is difficult to believe that the
female experiences no pleasurable sensation
when she hears the voice of the male that
directs her search. So that the song may be
actually repellent in the one case and attractive
in the other; and it is none the less repellent
when, as in the later stages, it attracts a
neighbouring male, for the attraction is then
of a different order, determined by the presence
of the condition which renders the pugnacious
nature susceptible and leads to attack. In a
sense, therefore, we can speak of "meaning"&mdash;though
not perhaps of "significance"&mdash;and
of "warning," when we refer to the prospective
value of the behaviour.</p>

<p>So much for the purpose of "song"; there
still remains the more difficult question&mdash;the
question of origin. Let me make clear what
I mean by origin. As we have already seen,
there is infinite diversity in the sexual voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
of different species; some are harsh and others
monotonous, and some strike the imagination
by their novelty whilst others are melodious;
and to the naturalist each, in its particular
way and in a particular degree, probably makes
some appeal according to the associations that
it arouses. But just why a Marsh-Warbler
is gifted with a voice that is so beautiful and
varied, whilst the Grasshopper-Warbler must
perforce remain content with a monotonous
trill; just why the tail feathers of the Snipe
have developed into an instrument, whilst the
Pied Woodpecker has developed muscles which
enable it to make use of a decayed branch as
an instrument&mdash;we know no more than we do
of the nature of the forces which lead the Reed-Warbler
to weave its nest to reeds, or the
caterpillar of the Elephant Hawk Moth to
assume so peculiar an attitude when disturbed.
When therefore I speak of the origin, I do
not refer to the mode of origin of variation;
I take for granted that variations somehow
arise, and I seek to ascertain whether there
is anything in the phenomena which we have
explored which might reasonably be held to
determine the survival of this one in preference
to that.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon the problem of song
and consider the numerous and diverse forms
in which it is manifested, we are apt to draw
a comparison between the sounds we hear
and those produced by musical instruments,
and hence to conclude that each bird is gifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
with a special instrument in virtue of which
it produces its characteristic melody. But there
is a very remarkable phenomenon connected
with the singing of birds which shows that this
is really not the case&mdash;I mean the phenomenon
of imitation. There are plenty of good imitators
amongst our native species, and the power of
imitation is not the exclusive property of those
which have reached a high degree of vocal
development, nor, for the matter of that, of
song-birds at all. Even the Jay, than which
few birds have a more raucous voice, that
"hoots" like the Wood-Owl, or copies the
sounds produced by the tail feathers of the
Snipe, will occasionally imitate the most
melodious strains of some other species; and
the Red-backed Shrike, whose sexual call is
principally a few harsh notes rapidly repeated,
bursts at times into perfect imitations of the
song of the Swallow, Linnet, or Chaffinch.
Nevertheless it is amongst such typical songsters
as the Warblers that we find the greatest volume
of imitation, and no limit seems to be placed
upon their capacity. The Marsh-Warbler can
utter the call of the Green Woodpecker, or sing
as the Nightingale does, with as much facility
as it sings its own song; and the Blackcap is
well-nigh as proficient in copying the cries
and melodies of surrounding species&mdash;and so,
if it were necessary, we might proceed to add
to the list.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate that different
songs are not represented by a corresponding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
number of different physiological contrivances;
for if the difference were really attributable to
some structural peculiarity, then the range of
sounds embraced in the call-notes and the sexual
call of any given species, must be the measure
of the capacity of its instrument; and no matter
how great its power of imitation may be, it
follows that it will only be capable of copying
those sounds which fall within that range.
There is plenty of evidence to show that the
power of imitation is almost unlimited, at all
events that it is not confined within such
narrow limits as are here demanded. Hence
it seems clear that the diversity of song is
not to be sought in structure, but in some
innate capacity to play one tune in preference
to another; and if this be so, and if
out of the same instrument, which has been
primarily evolved to further the biological end
of intercommunication, all manner of diverse
sounds can be made to proceed, the problem
of the origin of song is to that extent
simplified.</p>

<p>We must next inquire into the nature of
song, and endeavour to ascertain whether all
the individuals of a species are alike proficient,
or, failing this, whether there is any quality
which can be observed to be constant under
all conditions. I watch the Reed-Buntings in
a marsh and find that there are three males
occupying adjoining territories. Two of them
are fully mature and their plumage is bright:
that is to say the crown is black, the collar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
and breast are white, the flanks are dull white
spotted with black, and the mantle is reddish-brown.
The third is immature: the crown,
instead of being black, is suffused with brown;
the collar, instead of being white, is mottled with
brown; and the flanks are more heavily streaked
with brown. These three birds take up their
positions in February, and, as is their wont,
sing incessantly each day at daybreak. The
song of the first two is normal, including the
usual number of phrases which flow in no
definite sequence, but are combined and recombined
in different order, and the tone is
pure; that of the third, the immature bird,
is, however, very different; for just as in
comparison its plumage is dull, so the phrases
of its song are limited and reiterated with
great monotony, the tone is impure, and the
whole performance is dull and to our ears
unmusical. I watch them from February to
June, and observe the order in which they are
mated&mdash;first a mature male; next, after a short
interval, the immature male; and finally, after
a still longer interval, the remaining bird gets
a mate. As the season advances, still keeping
watch on the development of the plumage
and of the voice of the immature male, I
observe that no very definite change takes
place&mdash;that the colours remain dull, that
there is a conspicuous absence in the song of
certain phrases, and that the notes lack purity
of tone.</p>

<p>If now, instead of Reed-Buntings in a marsh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
I watch Yellow Buntings on a furze-covered
common, I find that, establishing themselves
early in February, they sing persistently, and
in a few weeks are paired. But what arrests
my attention more particularly is the quality
of the song; for although the voice is unmistakably
the voice of the Yellow Bunting,
yet it is incomplete and lacks the variety of
phrases and musical notation which we customarily
associate with the bird. Nevertheless, as
the season advances, there is a progressive
development in both these directions, and by
the end of March or the beginning of April the
song possesses all those qualities which appeal
to us so forcibly.</p>

<p>There is one other fact to which attention
must be drawn&mdash;the variation in the song of
the same species in different districts. As an
illustration let us take the case of the Chaffinch.
In Worcestershire the bird sings what I imagine
to be a normal song&mdash;the notes are clear and
the phrases are distinct and combined in
numerous ways. With the notes fresh in
mind I leave them and go to the west of
Donegal, where I am at once conscious of a
difference; not a subtle difference that perplexes
the mind and is difficult to trace, but
a change so remarkable that one is conscious
of a passing doubt as to whether after all the
voice is the voice of the Chaffinch; the song
is pitched in a lower key, certain phrases are
absent, the notes lack tone and are sometimes
even harsh, and the bird seems wholly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>capable
of reaching the higher notes to which
I am accustomed.</p>

<p>Now the immature Reed-Bunting, though to
our ears its song is but a poor representation
of that of the adult, gains a mate; the Yellow
Bunting pairs, and the discharge of the sexual
function may even have taken place before its
voice attains what we judge to be its full
development; and there are no grounds for
supposing that the Donegal Chaffinch, with its
less musical notes, has on that account any
the less chance of procreating its kind&mdash;facts
which demonstrate that the biological value
of song is neither to be sought in the purity
of tone, nor in the variety and combination of
phrases, nor, indeed, in any of those qualities
by which the human voice gains or loses merit,
and which leave us with no alternative but to
dismiss from our minds all &aelig;sthetic considerations
in the attempt to estimate its true
significance.</p>

<p>What, then, determines its value? Are
there any qualities which, whether the bird is
mature or immature, whether it is untrained
or has acquired fuller expression by practice,
whether it inhabits this district or that, are
alike constant? Well, no matter how great
the variation, no matter how much this voice
falls below or exceeds the standard, judged
from the human standpoint, attained by that,
even we, with our duller perception, have no
difficulty in recognising the species to which
the owner of the voice belongs; in other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
words, the song is always specific, and this is
the most noticeable, as it is the most remarkable,
characteristic.</p>

<p>There is still, however, another quality to
which I would draw attention&mdash;that of loudness.
The sounds produced are on the
whole alike penetrative, and the individuals
of any given district, even though the climate
by affecting their vocal muscles may
have modified the character of the song, are
at no disadvantage in this respect; neither are
the females on the same account the less likely
to hear the undeveloped voice of the immature
male.</p>

<p>We have then the following considerations:
firstly, there is the widespread and remarkable
phenomenon of imitation, from which we can
infer that the diversity of song is not due to
structural differences but must be sought in
some innate capacity to play one tune in
preference to another; secondly, not all the
individuals of the same species play a similar
tune&mdash;we find that there is in certain directions
a noticeable variation which nevertheless does
not seem to affect the question of success or
failure in the attainment of reproduction; in
the third place, in contrast with this variation,
we can observe a striking uniformity in two
important particulars, namely in the specific
character and penetrative power of the song&mdash;qualities
which we know are essential for the
purposes of "recognition" and "warning"; and
finally, from the general course of our investi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>gation,
we can infer that if a male had no
certain means of advertising its position, the
territory would not be brought into useful
relation in its life. Have we here sufficient
ground on which to construct a theory of
origin; in other words, has the evolution of
song been incidental to, and contributory to,
the evolution of the territory?</p>

<p>We have all along spoken of the song and
of the call-notes as if they were manifestations
of separate emotional states having their respective
and well-defined spheres of usefulness;
and while, speaking generally, this is a true
statement of the case, there is much evidence
to show that the relationship between them
is nevertheless very close. There are, for
example, quite a number of cases in which a
particular call-note is uttered with unusual
energy during sexual emotion, and is attached
to the song, of which it may be said to form a
part; but a still closer connection can be traced
in many simple melodies which are merely
compositions of social and family calls repeated
many times in succession, and even in some
of the more complex productions there will
be found indications of a similar construction.
And since this is so, since moreover,
in the seasonal vocal development of such a
bird as the Yellow Bunting, we can observe
the gradual elaboration from simple to complex&mdash;from
the repetition of single notes to
phrases and from phrases to the complete
melody&mdash;we have every reason to suppose that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
it is along these lines that the evolution of
the voice has proceeded.</p>

<p>In all probability there was a time when
vocal expression was limited to primitive social
and family cries which would be called into play
with special force during times of excitement,
more particularly during the sexual season
which is the period of maximum emotional
excitement. But the excitement would express
itself in all the congenital modes of behaviour
peculiar to the season, and thus the repetition
of these cries would become associated with
combat, with extravagant feats of flight, and
with other forms of motor response. Now the
more emotional individuals would be the more
pugnacious, and all the more likely therefore to
secure territory and so to procreate their kind;
and, being of an excitable disposition, they
would at the same time be the more vociferous.
Hence variations of the hereditary tendency to
vocal expression, even though in themselves
they were not of survival value, would be
fostered and preserved, so long as they were not
harmful, in virtue of their association with
pugnacity. But if, instead of being neutral,
they helped to further the biological end of
combat, the relationship between the voice and
pugnacity would be of a mutually beneficial
kind; and those individuals in which variation
in both directions happened to coincide, would
have a better chance of success in the attainment
of reproduction.</p>

<p>A territorial system, closely corresponding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to that which we have discussed, forms part of
the life behaviour of certain mammals, and of
its existence much lower in the scale of life
evidence is not wanting; from which we can
infer that it is not of recent origin, but that
the conditions in the external environment
demanded such a system at a remote period of
avian development. Now even in its incipient
stages the system must have involved a separation
of the sexes, and howsoever slight the
degree of separation may have been in comparison
with that which can be observed to-day,
inasmuch as the power of locomotion was then
less highly developed, mating could only have
proceeded satisfactorily providing that males fit
to breed had some adequate means of disclosing
their positions. Thus there is reason to think
that from the very commencement of the
process variations of emotional disposition
expressed through the voice would have been of
survival value.</p>

<p>But expressed in what direction, in loudness
and persistency of utterance, these are the
qualities which, I imagine, would have been
more likely to have facilitated the search of the
female? Yet if she were uncertain as to the
owner of the voice, neither loudness nor persistent
repetition would avail much; and as
species multiplied and the competition for the
means of living became increasingly severe, so
the necessity of a territory would have become
intensified, and so, too, with the extension of
range, would the separation of the sexes have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
been an ever-widening one; and as with their
multiplication, irregularities and delays in
mating, arising from the similarity of the calls,
would have increased in frequency, so a distinctive
call, which would have tended to minimise
these risks, would have come to possess
biological value.</p>

<p>Here we have a theory of origin, but origin
of what? Of certain characteristics of song&mdash;nothing
more; and therefore to suppose that it
furnishes a complete explanation, which satisfies
all the requirements of scientific logic, of so
wonderful an intonation as that, for example, of
the Marsh-Warbler, or that no other relationships,
except that of the territory, enter into the
total emotional complex, simplifying here or
elaborating there to meet the exigencies of
diverse circumstances&mdash;to suppose this would be
foolish. That there are many relationships
which even to-day are leading to modifications
in important particulars, but which at the
present time are beyond our cognisance, of this
there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>There is one process by which song may
have attained a fuller development, and which
would account in some measure for the elaboration,
inexplicable merely in terms of "recognition."
It is this: the effect of the sexual call
upon the female cannot well be neutral, it must
be either pleasurable or the reverse&mdash;it must, that
is to say, be accompanied by some suggestiveness,
and by suggestion I mean the arousing of some
emotion akin to that of the male; and if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
are degrees of suggestiveness, which well there
may be, some males will mate sooner than others
and some will remain mateless&mdash;this is the
theory of sexual selection. The question to be
decided here is whether the biological emphasis
is on loudness, or specific distinctness, or pitch,
or modulation, or the manner in which the
phrases are combined&mdash;that is, on some qualities
in preference to others&mdash;or whether the emphasis
is on the whole. We have already seen, and it
is well known, that there is much variation in
the voices of different individuals of the same
species, and thus the first condition of the theory
is fulfilled. Now the conditions which lead to
variation are threefold&mdash;immaturity, seasonal
sexual development, and isolation. Of the
three, the variation in the case of the immature
bird is the most instructive; the tone is not so
pure, the combination of phrases is incomplete,
and elaboration is imperfect, and yet, notwithstanding
all these imperfections, we can observe
that the bird pairs as readily as does the adult.
But even if we lacked this demonstrative
evidence, we should still be justified in assuming
that such must be the case, for we know from
experience in the preservation of game, where
there is no surer way of reducing the stock than
by leaving too high a percentage of old cocks,
that for the young bird to be at any disadvantage
in competition with the adult is detrimental, if
not disastrous, to the species. So that while
there is plenty of evidence of variation in those
particular qualities which appeal to our &aelig;sthetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
faculties, there is at the same time evidence
which demonstrates that such variations exercise
no influence on the course of mating; and
inasmuch as it is difficult to conceive of
any voice departing more from the normal
type in these particular qualities than the
immature does from the adult, if there be
degrees of suggestive influence, we must seek
it in some other direction. There remain the
two other characteristics which we found to
be constant under all circumstances, namely,
loudness and specific distinctness; and if, in
addition to serving the purpose of disclosing
the positions of the males, they serve to
evoke some emotion in the female, which
helps to further the biological end of mating,
so much the more reason is there for their
survival.</p>

<p>There can be no question that this ingenious
and attractive theory, if it were true in its
special application to song, would immensely
simplify interpretation, and moreover that
preferential mating would contribute not a little
to the success of the whole territorial system.
No one can deny the strength of the argument:
that the sexual instinct, like all other instincts,
must require a stimulus of an appropriate kind;
that the effect of the sexual call upon the
female cannot be neutral; and hence the probability
that stimulation varies too; no one, I
say, can question the strength of this evidence,
and, one might add, of the evidence derived
from the analogy of the human voice. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
when we have said this, we have said all;
and our acceptance of the hypothesis, so far
as song is concerned, must remain provisional
so long as the evidence remains but secondary
evidence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>THE RELATION OF THE TERRITORY TO THE
SYSTEM OF REPRODUCTION</h4>


<p>In the first two chapters I tried to show that
the inherited nature of the male leads it to
remain in a definite place at a definite season
and to become intolerant of the approach of
members of its own sex, and that a result is
thus attained which the word "territory" in
some measure describes. But the use of this
word is nevertheless open to criticism, for it
denotes a human end upon which the highest
faculties have been brought to bear, and consequently
we have to be on our guard lest our
conception of the "territory" should tend to
soar upwards into regions which require a level
of mental development not attained by the
bird. It is necessary to bear this in mind
now we have come to consider the meaning
of the territory, or rather the position that it
occupies in the whole scheme of reproduction.</p>

<p>Relationship to a territory within the interrelated
whole of a bird's life serves more than
one purpose, and not always the same purpose
in the case of every species. We have only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
to glance at the life-histories of divergent forms
to see that the territory has been gradually adjusted
to suit their respective needs&mdash;limited in
size here, expanded there, to meet new conditions
as they arose. Now some may think that the
theory would be more likely to be true if the
territory had but one purpose to fulfil, and
that one the same for every species; and they
may see nothing but weakness in the multiplication
of ways in which I shall suggest it may
be serviceable. But such an objection, if it
were raised, would arise from a mistaken conception,
a conception which, instead of starting
with a relationship and working up to the
"territory," sees in the "territory" something
of the bird's own selection and thence works
back to its origin. Holding the view that it
is nothing but a term in a complex relationship
which has gradually become interwoven in
the history of the individual, I see no reason
why the fact of its serving a double or a treble
purpose should not be a stronger argument
for its survival. I now propose to examine
the various ways in which the territory may
have been of use in furthering the life of the
individual, and the circumstances in the inorganic
world which have helped to determine its
survival.</p>

<p>The purpose that it serves depends largely
upon the conditions in the external environment&mdash;the
climate, the supply of food, the
supply of breeding-stations, and the presence
of enemies. Hence its purpose varies with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
varying conditions of existence. But before
we proceed to examine the particular ways
in which it has been modified to suit the needs
of particular classes of species, and the reason
for such modifications, we must inquire whether
there is not some way in which it has been
serviceable alike to every species, or at least
to a large majority of them.</p>

<p>Success in the attainment of reproduction
depends upon the successful discharge of the
sexual function; and the discharge of the sexual
function depends primarily upon an individual
of one sex coming into contact with one of the
opposite sex at the appropriate season and
when its appropriate organic condition arises.
Now the power of locomotion is so highly
developed in birds that it may seem unreasonable
to suppose that males and females would
have any difficulty in meeting when their
inherited nature required that they should do
so, still less reasonable to suggest that this
power might even act as a hindrance to
successful mating. Nevertheless, if we try to
picture to ourselves the conditions which would
obtain if the movements of both sexes were in
no wise controlled, and mating were solely
dependent upon fortuitous gatherings, we shall
come, I fancy, to no other conclusion than that
much loss of valuable time and needless waste
of energy would often be incurred in the search,
and that many an individual would fail to
breed just because its wanderings took it into
districts in which, at the time, there happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to be too many of this sex or too few of that.
And as the power of locomotion increased
and the distribution of the sexes became more
and more irregular, so the opportunity would
be afforded for the development of any variation
which would have tended to facilitate the
process of pairing, and by so doing have conferred
upon the individuals possessing it, some
slight advantage over their fellows.</p>

<p>What would have been the most likely
direction for variation to have taken? Any
restriction upon the freedom of movement of
both sexes would only have added to the
difficulties of mating; but if restriction had
been imposed upon one sex, whilst the other
had been left free to wander, some order would
have been introduced into the process. That
the territory serves to restrict the movements
of the males and to distribute them uniformly
throughout all suitable localities, there can be
no question; and since the instinctive behaviour
in relation to it is timed to appear at a very
early stage in the seasonal sexual process, the
males are in a position to receive mates before
the impulse to mate begins to assert itself
in the female.</p>

<p>We will take the Ruff as an example.
According to Mr. Edmund Selous, pairing, in
this species, is promiscuous&mdash;the Ruffs are
polygamous, the Reeves polyandrous. Suppose,
then, that upon this island of some few
miles in circumference, whereon his investigations
were made, the movements of neither Ruff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
nor Reeve were subject to control, that the
birds wandered in all directions, and that the
union of the sexes were fortuitous, would the
result have been satisfactory? We must
remember that the Reeve requires more than
one Ruff to satisfy her sexual instinct; we must
also bear in mind the possibility that the
functioning of her instinct may be subject to
some periodicity, and we ask whether, under
these circumstances, accidental gatherings would
meet all the requirements of the situation.
Now, manifestly, she must be in a position to
find males when her appropriate organic condition
arises. But in the absence of any system in the
distribution of the sexes, how could delay be
avoided, or how could a uniform discharge of
the sexual function be assured? There is,
however, a system. In the first place, there
are the assembly grounds to which the birds
repair season after season; and then, on the
assembly grounds, there are the territories,
represented, as Mr. Selous tells us, by depressions
where the grass by long use has been worn
away, and each depression is owned by one
particular Ruff. The assembly grounds have
the effect of splitting up and scattering the
birds, and the number of Ruffs at any one particular
meeting place is limited by the territories;
with the result that Ruffs fit to breed are evenly
distributed and always to be found in certain
definite places, and the Reeves know by experience
where to find them.</p>

<p>The advantage of this territorial system is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
therefore apparent. Instead of this district
being overcrowded and that one deserted;
instead of there being too many of one sex
here and too few of the other sex there; instead
of a high percentage of individuals failing to
procreate their kind, just because circumstances
over which they have no control prevent their
discovering one another at the appropriate time&mdash;each
sex has its allotted part to play, each
district has its allotted number of inhabitants,
and the waste of energy and the loss of time
incurred in the process of mating is reduced to
a minimum.</p>

<p>Let us return again to the question of
fortuitous mating, and consider the position of
a male and female that have discovered one
another by accident and have paired; what will
be the subsequent course of their behaviour?
We are assuming, of course, that a territory
forms no part of their life-history. If the
discharge of the sexual function takes place
immediately and the ovaries of the female are
in an advanced state of seasonal development,
the construction of the nest will proceed without
delay&mdash;and the nest will answer the same
purpose as the territory in so far as it serves to
restrict the movements of the birds and tends to
make them remain in, or return to, its vicinity;
but if not, there will be an interval during which
both sexes will continue to wander as before,
guided only by the scarcity or abundance of
food. In the first case, there will be the
attraction of the nest to prevent any untimely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
separation; in the second, there will be nothing
in the external environment to induce them to
remain in any particular spot. Now if we turn
to any common species and observe the sequence
of events in the life of different pairs, we shall
find that pairing is seldom followed by an
immediate attempt to build; that an interval
of inactivity is the rule rather than the exception,
and that this interval varies in different
species, in different individuals, and in different
seasons. Our imaginary male and female will
therefore be faced with considerable difficulty;
for with nothing in the external environment to
attract them and with no restriction imposed
upon the direction or extent of their flight, their
union will continue to be, as it began by being,
fortuitous. Next, let us consider their position
were a disposition to establish a territory to
form part of the inherited nature of the male.
Each one will then be free to seek food when
and where it wills and to associate with other
individuals without the risk of permanent
separation from its mate; and, no matter how
long an interval may elapse between mating and
nest-building, each one will be in a position to
find the other when the appropriate moment for
doing so arrives. Hence, while preserving
freedom of movement for each individual, the
territory will render their future, as a pair,
secure.</p>

<p>No doubt the course of behaviour, as we
observe it to-day in the lives of many species, is
the outcome of, rather than the condition which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
has led to, the evolution of the territory. Thus,
in many cases, we find that early mating is the
rule rather than the exception; we find that the
sexes frequently separate to seek their food, and
fly away temporarily in different directions;
and, under exceptional climatic conditions, we
find that they even revert to their winter routine
and form flocks; only, however, to return to
their territories, as pairs, under more congenial
conditions. Yellow Buntings, for example, pair
comparatively early in the season&mdash;some in the
latter part of February, others in March, and
others again in April; and some build their
nests in April, others in May. There is a gorse-covered
common which I have in mind, a
favourite breeding resort of this species.
Between this common and the surrounding
country, the birds constantly pass to and fro.
If you watch a particular male you will observe
that it sings for a while in its territory, that it
then rises in the air and disappears from view,
and finally that it returns to the tree, bush, or
mound which constitutes its headquarters, where
it again sings. Meanwhile the female, with
which there is every reason to believe that this
male has paired, behaves similarly; she, too, flies
to the surrounding country and in time returns
with equal certainty. Sometimes male and
female accompany one another&mdash;that is, they
leave simultaneously and likewise return; at
other times, though they depart together, the
male returns alone; or the male may disappear
in one direction whilst the female does so in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
another&mdash;and, on the whole, there is a sameness
in the direction of flight taken by the same pairs
on different occasions. An interval of nearly
two months may thus elapse between mating
and nest-building, during which the sexes are
not only often apart but often separated by a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>What does this species gain by the
individuals belonging to it mating so early in
the season? If the appropriate condition which
leads the females to seek males were to arise
in each individual at a late date, the first stage
in the process&mdash;mating&mdash;would not be completed
before the second&mdash;the discharge of the
sexual function&mdash;were due to begin. Thus,
instead of having ample time, the females
would have but a short period in which to
discover males; and this in some cases might
lead to delay, in others to failure, and in
others again to needlessly severe competition,
entailing physical exhaustion at a critical
moment in their lives. Hence those females
in which the appropriate organic condition
developed early in the season would not only
be more likely to find males, but would be
in a position to rear more broods than those
in which it developed late; and they would
have a better chance of leaving offspring,
which, in their turn, would reproduce the
peculiarities of their parents. Moreover, within
certain limitations, the more these successful
females varied in the date of their development,
the less severe would be the competition, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the more uniformly successful would the mating
of all the individuals in a given district tend
to become. But all of this renders an interval
of sexual inactivity unavoidable; an interval
which must constitute a danger unless there
were something in the external environment
to prevent the male and female from drifting
apart. Inasmuch, then, as the occupation of
a territory serves to remove all possibility of
permanent separation, I suggest that its evolution
has afforded the condition under which
this beneficial procedure has developed&mdash;free
to mate when they will, free to seek food
where they will, free to pursue their normal
routine of existence, and to meet all exigencies
as they arise in their ordinary daily life&mdash;whilst
free to do this, their future, as a pair,
is nevertheless secure.</p>

<p>Thus far we have considered the territory
in its relation to the discharge of the sexual
function. In many of the lower forms of life,
the success or the failure of reproduction, so
far as the individual is concerned, may be said
to end with the completion of the sexual act&mdash;the
female has but to deposit her eggs in a
suitable environment and then her work is done,
because in due course and under normal conditions
of temperature the young hatch out, and
from the first are able to fend for themselves.
And so, when we come to consider the question
of reproduction in the higher forms of life, we
are apt to focus attention too much upon the
sexual function and too little upon the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>tributory
factors, the failure of any one of
which would mean failure of the whole. For
a bird, success in the attainment of reproduction
does not merely imply the successful discharge
of the sexual function; much more is demanded;
it must find somewhere to build its nest and
to lay its eggs, it must shield its young from
extremes of temperature and protect them from
enemies, and it must be in a position to supply
them with food at regular intervals. And,
consequently, every situation is not equally
favourable for rearing young; there must be a
plentiful supply of food of the right kind in
the immediate vicinity of the nest, and it must
be in greatest abundance just at the moment
when it is most urgently needed&mdash;that is to
say, during the first few weeks after the birth
of the young. Success, therefore, depends upon
manifold relationships which centre in the
station, and these relationships vary in intensity
with the conditions of existence.</p>

<p>First, then, let us examine the problem from
the point of view of the food-supply. There
are many species whose success in rearing
offspring is largely dependent upon the rapidity
with which they can obtain food; and it makes
but little difference which species we choose
out of many&mdash;Finch, Bunting, Warbler, or
Chat. I shall choose the Buntings, as their
life-history in broad outline conforms to the
general type, and, moreover, their behaviour
is fresh in my mind. The young are born in a
very helpless state; they are without covering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
&mdash;fragile organisms, ill-fitted, one would think, to
withstand extremes of temperature, and wholly
incapable of protecting themselves from enemies
of any description. For the first three days
after they are hatched the female spends much
of her time in brooding them, and, when she
is thus occupied, the male sometimes brings
food to her, which she proceeds to distribute
or swallows. But all the young cannot be fed,
neither are they ready to be fed, at the same
moment; and the parents have besides to find
food for themselves, and the nest has to be
cleaned&mdash;all of which necessitates the young
being exposed to the elements at frequent
intervals. Now it is impossible to observe the
instinctive routine of the parents, when the
young need attention, without being impressed
with the conative aspect of their behaviour.
Why, we ask, are the movements of the female
so brisk; why does she seek food and clean
the nest so hurriedly; why, if her instinctive
routine is interrupted, do her actions and her
attitude betray such bewilderment? I take it
that the only answer we can give to these
questions is that the part of her inherited
nature which predominates just at this particular
time is to brood. But why is brooding
of such importance? Partly to maintain the
young at the proper temperature, and thereby
to induce sleep&mdash;and sleep for offspring newly
hatched is as important as food&mdash;and partly to
protect them from the risk of exposure to
extremes of temperature. This latter danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
is no imaginary one. Examine a young bird
that has recently left the egg; observe its
nakedness; and consider what it has to withstand&mdash;a
temperature that may rise to 70&deg; F.
or may fall to 40&deg; F., the tropical rain of a
thunderstorm or the persistent drizzle of many
hours' duration, the scorching effect of a
summer sun or the chilling effect of a cold
north-easterly wind, and, constantly, the sudden
change of temperature each time that the
parent leaves the nest. One marvels that
it ever does survive; one marvels at the
evolution of a constitution sufficiently elastic
to withstand such changes. But, however
much the constitution may give us cause to
wonder, it is clear that much depends upon
the parents. A slight inefficiency of the
instinctive response which the presence of the
young evokes, a little slowness in searching
for food or sluggishness in returning to the
nest, might lead to exposure and prove fatal.
And, however much is demanded of the parents,
it is clear that much also depends upon the
relationships in the external environment; for
no matter how sensitive or how well attuned
the instinctive response of the parent may be,
it will avail but little in the presence of
unfavourable conditions in the environment.</p>

<p>Everything turns upon the question of the
effect of exposure. And in order to ascertain
how far extremes of temperature are injurious,
I removed the nests of various species containing
newly hatched young, and, placing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
in surroundings that afforded the customary
amount of protection from the elements, I made
a note of the temperature and the atmospheric
conditions and then observed the condition of
the young at frequent intervals. Details of
these experiments will be found at the end of
the chapter.</p>

<p>The experiments with the Blackbirds and
the Whitethroats gave the most interesting
results. Both broods of each species were
respectively of much the same age, yet one
brood of Blackbirds survived for five, and the
other only for two and a half hours, and one
brood of Whitethroats lived for twelve hours
whilst the other succumbed in a little over an
hour. This difference is rather remarkable;
and it seems clear that the power of resistance
of the young diminishes rapidly when the
temperature falls below 52&deg; F. It must be
borne in mind, however, that the conditions
under which the experiments were made were,
on the whole, favourable&mdash;the weather was dry,
the temperature was not unusually low, nor was
the wind exceptionally strong or cold; and even
in those cases in which the young succumbed so
rapidly, the atmospheric conditions could by no
means be regarded as abnormal.</p>

<p>What, then, would happen in an unusually
wet or cold breeding season? For how long
would the young then survive? In the spring
and early summer of the year 1916, I was
fortunate in observing the effect of exposure
under natural but inclement conditions. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
happened to be watching the Yellow Buntings
on Hartlebury Common&mdash;200 acres of Upper
Soft Red Sandstone, profusely overgrown with
cross-leaved heath (<i>Erica tetralix</i>), ling (<i>Calluna
vulgaris</i>), and furze (<i>Ulex</i>)&mdash;in one corner of
which eight males had established adjoining
territories covering some fifteen acres of ground.
The males obtained mates towards the end of
March or at the beginning of April; nests were
built in the middle of May, and the successful
pairs hatched out their young in June. On
the 10th June the weather became exceptionally
cold, and during the next ten days the temperature
fell at times to 40&deg; F. during the daytime.
Slight frosts were registered at night in the
district, and the young bracken, which covered
the Common in places, had the appearance of
having been scorched and eventually withered
away. At the coldest period of this cold spell
the young were hatched in two of the nests&mdash;in
the first one on the 10th June, and in the second
a day or so later; and on the morning of the 10th
June, having found a suitable position near the
first nest, I began to watch the movements of
the parents, with the intention of keeping some
record of their behaviour each day so long as
the young needed attention. An hour passed
without their appearing, and on examining the
young I found that they were cold, feeble, and
unresponsive, but the female presently arrived
and went to the nest. Later in the day the
young were lively and responded freely when
the nest was approached, but nevertheless I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
impressed with the length of time during which
the parents were absent; for, judging by the
experience of previous experiment, there seemed
to be every likelihood of their losing their
offspring in such abnormally cold weather,
unless they brooded them more persistently.
On the 11th June at 5.50 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> neither parent was
to be seen and the young could scarcely be made
to respond; but shortly afterwards both male
and female appeared, and, after remaining a
few minutes, again disappeared without even
approaching the nest. At 6.45 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> no attempt
had been made to brood and the young were
then so feeble that they were scarcely able to
open their mouths, and at 6 <span class="smcaplc">P.M.</span> one was still
alive but the remaining three were dead. Yet
the parents returned and the female went to the
nest; and, from a distance of a few feet, I
watched her brooding the living and the dead.
At 5.45 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> the following day the remaining
young bird had succumbed, the temperature
then being 49&deg; F.</p>

<p>At the second nest, I was unable to watch
the behaviour of the parents so closely. On the
15th June the nest contained three young from
three to four days old, and during the morning
of that and the succeeding day nothing unusual
occurred, with the exception that the period of
exposure seemed, as in the former case, to be
too long. On the 17th June at 3.10 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> the
young had collapsed and were stiff, but the
parents were in their territory and anxious
apparently to attend to their brood. At 9.15<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> only two of the young were left in the
nest, and though I searched amongst the undergrowth
and in the gorse bush in which the nest
was placed, no trace of the third bird was to be
found. Of the two remaining young, one was
alive and responsive but the other was dead,
and though the female attended assiduously to
the sole surviving offspring, yet it too had
succumbed by the following morning.</p>

<p>In a third territory, there was a nest containing
four eggs. These eggs were due to
hatch at much the same time as those in the
two nests just referred to, but they failed to do
so, and an examination showed that they contained
well developed but dead chicks.</p>

<p>To what can the death of the young and of
the chicks in the eggs be attributed? Not to
any failure in the instinctive response of the
females, for they fed their young, they brooded
them, they even brooded the dead as well as the
living, and probably did all that racial preparation
had fitted them to do. Yet the fact that
the young in the second nest were lifeless and
exposed at 3 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> seems to betoken absence on
the part of the parents during the night, and
may be interpreted as a failure of the parental
instinctive response. Let us return for a
moment to the experiments. These showed, it
will be remembered, that a rise or fall in the
temperature of but a few degrees was sufficient
to make an astonishing difference in the length
of time that the young were able to survive
without their parents; that when the tempera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>ture
reached 58&deg; F. the bodies of the young
retained their warmth, and that under such
conditions even a night's exposure had little, if
any, effect; so that even supposing that the
parents were absent during the night, the death
of the young cannot be said to have been due to
a failure of the parental instinct, because under
normal conditions&mdash;and under such has their
instinctive routine been evolved&mdash;their absence
would not have prejudiced the existence of the
offspring. I attribute the collapse of the young
solely to the exceptional cold that prevailed at
just the most critical time, and I base this
conclusion partly on the experience gained from
experiment, but mainly on their condition
observed at different intervals; for during
exposure they collapsed rapidly, their flesh
became cold and their movements sluggish,
their response grew weak, and gradually they
became more and more feeble until they could
scarcely close their bills after the mandibles had
been forced asunder. Yet, even after having
reached so acute a stage of collapse, the warmth
from the body of the brooding bird was
sufficient to restore them temporarily; once
more they would become lively and responsive,
only, however, to revert to the previous condition
soon after the parent had again abandoned
them. Doubtless their power of resistance
grew less and less during each successive period
of exposure.</p>

<p>If the nestling Bunting is to be freed from
the risk of exposure, it is evident that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
must be, in the vicinity of the nest, an adequate
supply of food upon which the parents can draw
liberally. Hence those pairs that exercise
dominion over the few acres surrounding the
nest, and are thus able to obtain food rapidly,
will stand a better chance of rearing their
offspring than others which have no certain
supply to draw upon&mdash;and this, I believe, is one
of the biological ends for which the territory has
been evolved. But it must not be supposed
that each pair finds, or even attempts to find,
the whole of the food within its territory, or
that it is necessary for the theory that it should
do so; all that is required is that such overcrowding
as might lead to prolonged absence on
the part of the parents and inordinate exposure
of the young shall be avoided. So that the
problem has to be considered not merely from
the point of view of the individual, but from the
larger point of view of all the pairs inhabiting
a given area.</p>

<p>Now there were eight pairs of Yellow
Buntings occupying the one corner of Hartlebury
Common, and their territories in the
aggregate covered some fifteen acres. The
birds obtained part of their food-supply amongst
the gorse and in some young scattered oak-trees,
and part in an adjoining coppice and on
the surrounding arable land. But they were
not the sole occupants of this corner of
the Common; other insectivorous species had
territories there also&mdash;amongst which were
Whitethroats, Grasshopper-Warblers, Willow-Warblers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Whinchats, Stonechats, Meadow-Pipits,
Tree-Pipits, and Skylarks. Suppose
then that there had been sixteen pairs of Yellow
Buntings instead of eight; that there had been
other pairs, which assuredly there were, inhabiting
the locality; that they had also resorted,
which assuredly they did, to the coppice and
arable ground for the purpose of securing food;
and that their numbers had also been increased
in a similar ratio&mdash;would a supply of food for
all have been forthcoming with the necessary
regularity and promptitude? Well, the parents
might have had to travel a little farther; but
even if they had been compelled to do so, their
absence would only have been prolonged by so
many minutes the more, and under normal
conditions what harmful result to the offspring
could possibly have followed? The question for
us, however, is not what might have occurred
under normal conditions, but whether the life
behaviour is so adjusted as to meet the exigencies
of diverse, and in this case of abnormal, circumstances.
Now the capacity of the young to
resist exposure diminishes very rapidly when the
temperature falls below the normal&mdash;the danger
zone seems to be reached at approximately
52&deg; F., and the length of time during which they
survive then becomes astonishingly short&mdash;and
moreover the fall in the temperature would tend
to decrease the supply of insect life upon which
they depend, so that if the size of the territories
had been reduced by one half, and the parents
in consequence had been compelled to seek their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
food at a greater distance, can it be doubted
that the cumulative effect of even a few minutes
of additional exposure would have been detrimental,
if not disastrous, to the offspring?</p>

<p>We speak, however, of the parents extending
their journeys a little farther in this direction or
a little farther in that, as though they could do
so with impunity except in so far as it affected
themselves, or their offspring, or the other
Yellow Buntings inhabiting that particular area.
But, most certainly, any extension would have
meant so much encroachment upon the available
means of support of other members of the
species inhabiting adjoining areas, whose young
in turn would have been liable to have been
affected; and, with even greater certainty, the
Whitethroats, the Stonechats, the Tree-Pipits,
and the Willow-Warblers that had also
established themselves in that one corner of
the Common would have been hard pressed to
find sufficient food with sufficient rapidity.</p>

<p>Let me give another illustration of a somewhat
different kind. Lapwings, as we saw in
the previous chapters, establish territories and
guard them from intrusion with scrupulous care.
The young are able to leave the nest soon after
they are hatched, and consequently the parents
are not necessarily obliged to bring food <i>to</i>
them&mdash;they can, if they so choose, lead them <i>to</i>
the food. Whether each pair limits its search
for food to its territory, I do not know. But
even supposing that all ownership of territory
were to lapse directly the young were hatched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
that the boundaries were to cease to exist, and
that the birds were free to wander at will
without fear of molestation, the end for which
the territory had been evolved would none the
less have been obtained; for inasmuch as the
parents are accompanied by their young, it
matters not in what part of the meadow they
seek their food; all that matters is that the
number of families shall not exceed the available
supply of food. So far, then, as the Lapwing is
concerned, the territory fulfils its purpose when
once it limits the number of males, since, by
doing so, it limits the number of families and
prevents undue pressure upon the means of
support.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are many birds that
seem to rely entirely upon the territory to
supply them with all that is necessary. Each
Warbler seeks its food within the precincts
of its own particular domain, and, except in
occasional instances, neither resorts to neutral
ground nor makes excursions into the locality
immediately surrounding the territory, as does
the Bunting. Probably it would be disastrous
if it attempted to do so, for since its young
at birth are so delicate and so susceptible to
changes of temperature, it cannot afford to
be absent from them for long. Of the two
experiments made with young Whitethroats,
one was made under favourable and the other
under unfavourable conditions. In this latter
case the temperature was 50&deg; F., and the young,
it may be remembered, only survived for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
little over one hour. Now exposure at that
temperature is evidently dangerous, but it
would be still more dangerous if the weather
were wet instead of dry, and the temperature
46&deg; F. instead of 50&deg; F.; and it is, I imagine,
on this account that the impulse to brood is
so strongly implanted in the female. No
sooner, it seems, does she depart than she
returns with a small quantity of food which
she hurriedly distributes and immediately settles
down to brood; and if forcibly prevented from
returning, her attitude betrays symptoms of
what, humanly speaking, we should term great
distress. If, then, the conditions in the external
environment were such as would make it
difficult for the female to obtain food rapidly,
what advantage would she derive from so
strongly developed an impulse? Might it
not be a disadvantage? Might it not mean
that she would abandon the search too readily
and be content to return with an insufficient
supply, and might not that be as injurious to
the young as prolonged exposure? Manifestly
the impulse to brood could only have developed
strength in so far as it fitted in with all the
other factors that make for survival; and the
principal factor in the external environment
seems to be the territory. How could the
young have been freed from the risk of
exposure if the impulse to brood had not
been so strongly implanted in the parent?
How could the impulse to brood have been
free to develop if a supply of food had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
been first insured? How could the supply
of food have been insured if numbers of the
same species had been allowed to breed in
close proximity?</p>

<p class="tb">From the foregoing facts it is clear that the
young of many species are at birth susceptible
to cold and unable to withstand prolonged
exposure. The parents must therefore be in
a position to obtain food rapidly, and consequently
it is important that there should be
an ample supply in the vicinity of the nest.
This end the territory certainly serves to
promote; it roughly insures that the bird
population of a given area is in proportion to
the available means of subsistence, and it
thus reduces the risk of prolonged exposure
to which the young are always liable.</p>


<p>This leads on to a consideration of those
cases in which the question of securing food
is subordinate to the question of securing a
station suitable for reproduction.</p>

<p>I take the Guillemot as an example. In
principle its behaviour is similar to that of the
Bunting; the male repairs to a definite place,
isolates itself, and becomes pugnacious. But
the Guillemot is generally surrounded by other
Guillemots, and the birds are often so densely
packed along the ledges that there is scarcely
standing room, so it seems, for all of them.
Nevertheless the isolation of the individual
is, in a sense, just as complete as that of the
individual Bunting, for each one is just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
vigilant in resisting intrusion upon its few
square feet as the Bunting is in guarding its
many square yards, so that the evidence seems
to show that that part of the inherited nature
which is the basis of the territory is much
the same in both species. What we have then
to consider is, What is the biological value to
the Guillemot of an inherited nature which,
for the Bunting, has utility in relation to the
supply of food for the young? Up to a point,
the act of securing a territory has like value
for each respective species, whether the area
occupied be large or small&mdash;that is to say, it
enables the one sex to discover the other with
reasonable promptitude.</p>

<p>For the greater part of the year, Guillemots
live at sea; singly, in twos or threes, or in
small parties, they move upon the face of the
waters, extending their wanderings far away
from land, out into the broad ocean, where
for weeks together they face the gales and
heavy seas of the Atlantic. But in due course
and in response to internal organic changes,
they return, like the Warbler, to their breeding
grounds&mdash;rocky headlands or islands appropriately
situated and affording the appropriate
rock formation. During all these months of
wandering, the majority seem to ignore the
land, to pass away from it altogether, and to
spread themselves over the surface of the ocean
regardless of mainland or island. Some useful
observations, which throw some light on the
distance that Guillemots are accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
wander from land, were made by Lieut. B. R.
Stewart during a number of voyages between
various ports in Great Britain and Ireland and
ports in North America, principally New York
and Quebec. Thus, on the 24th March, large
numbers were seen in lat. 55&deg; N., long. 24&deg; W.,
five hundred miles approximately from land,
though on the following day&mdash;four hundred
miles off Tory Island&mdash;they were not so plentiful.
Again, on the 1st October, in lat. 53&deg; N., long.
27&deg; W., seven hundred miles or so from land, one
bird was seen, whilst on the following day, in
lat. 52&deg; N., long. 21&deg; W., a single individual
was washed on board by the heavy seas and
seemed little the worse for the adventure.
Within two hundred miles of the west coast
of Ireland, he found them plentiful on various
occasions. From this it is clear that the circumstances
under which the bird lives for many
months in succession must impose a considerable
strain upon its constitution; and how it is able
to withstand the buffeting of wind and water,
to secure its food, and to endure, is a mystery.
It is important, therefore, that the young bird
should be properly nourished and protected
from anything that might harm its constitution,
and important, too, that the parents should be
freed from any undue strain during the course
of reproduction.</p>

<p>The conditions which the breeding station
has to fulfil are threefold: in the first place,
it must be in proximity to the food-supply;
secondly, it must provide the necessary shelter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
for the egg and for the helpless offspring;
and, in the third place, it must be so situated
that the young can reach the water in safety.
We will examine these conditions one by
one.</p>

<p>The proximity to the food-supply is a
consideration of some importance. The life
of the Guillemot during the winter is a
strenuous one; we know that large numbers
succumb in stormy weather, and we can infer
that slight constitutional defects might make
all the difference between failure and success;
and, therefore, the less severely the constitution
of the parent is taxed during reproduction,
and the more securely the constitution of the
offspring is built up, the greater prospect
will both have of resisting the hardships of the
winter successfully. Much, then, will depend
upon the distance the parents have to travel
in order to obtain food. The farther the
breeding station is removed from the feeding
ground the greater the physical strain which
will be imposed upon the birds, and the greater
the chance will there be of the offspring being
improperly nourished. Now the food consists
of small fish, largely of sand-eels, which are
secured in deep water, and the abundance of
which varies, possibly according to the nature
of the currents. Hence cliffs which are situated
away from the water, or from which the water
recedes at low tide, or which are surrounded
by an area of shallow water, and are thus not in
proximity to the feeding ground, even though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
they may fulfil the second and third condition,
will not answer the requirements of a breeding
station.</p>

<p>Of no less importance is the type of rock-formation.
Not every formation affords the
necessary ledges upon which the egg can be
deposited with safety&mdash;the face of the cliff may
be too smooth, or too jagged, or the shelves
may run at too acute an angle. Many of the
large assemblages of Guillemots in the British
Islands are found where the rock is quartzite,
mica-schist, limestone, or chalk. The reason of
this is that such rocks are weathered along the
planes of stratification, of jointing, of cleavage,
or of foliation&mdash;the strata being probably of
unequal durability&mdash;with the result that innumerable
shelves, ledges, and caverns, which
are taken advantage of by the birds, form a
network over the face of the cliff. But only
those ledges can be made use of which are
placed at a considerable height above the water,
because, when the cliff faces the open sea, the
lower ones are liable to be washed in stormy
weather by the incoming swell and thus become
untenable. There is a small cove in the midst
of the most precipitous part of the breeding
station at Horn Head, wherein the shingly
shore shelves rapidly to the Atlantic and faces
to the west. Here, towards the end of July,
young Kittiwake Gulls can sometimes be found
washed up on the beach&mdash;some living, but in
every stage of exhaustion, others dead, and in
every stage of decomposition; here is the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
bird, recently caught by the swell and thrown
upon the shore, lying side by side with the
remains of others that had previously succumbed
to starvation&mdash;on every side evidence of the
devastation wrought by the Atlantic. May not
some of this destruction have been brought
about by the nests having been placed upon
the lower ledges within reach of an exceptionally
heavy sea? Hence much depends upon the
nature of the rock-formation, and many a
mighty precipice, even though it may fulfil
the first and third condition, is nevertheless
valueless as a breeding station.</p>

<p>Finally, the young bird must occupy a ledge
from which it can reach the water in safety.
There is much difference of opinion as to the
manner in which it leaves the ledge, but all
agree that it does so before it is capable of
sustained flight. If, then, the face of the cliffs
were made up of a series of broken precipices, or
if the rocks at the base projected out into the
water, or if detached rocks abounded in the
waters beneath, the mortality amongst the chicks
would no doubt be considerable.</p>

<p>The coast-line of Co. Donegal will illustrate
the foregoing remarks. On the southern and
western side of the Slieve League promontory
there is no real Guillemot station; only on the
northern side&mdash;the quartzite in the vicinity of
Tormore&mdash;are the birds to be found in large
numbers. Northwards from here, a wild and
rugged coast is passed over before other stations
are reached&mdash;at the eastern end of Tory Island<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and on Horn Head; and beyond this, to the
east, there are none, not even on the old rocks
that form the promontory of Inishowen. Why,
we ask, do countless numbers crowd the ledges
of Horn Head, whilst they are absent from the
precipices of Slieve League; why, too, are they
absent from the granite cliffs of Owey? The
reason is not far to seek. Either the face of
the cliff is made up of a series of broken
precipices, or the face of the precipices is
too smooth, or the otherwise suitable ledges
are situated too near the water, or the water
recedes from the base of the cliff at low tide.
Many miles of rock-bound coast are thus useless
for the purpose of reproduction.</p>

<p>Now when we bear in mind how large an
expanse of coast is formed of blown sand or of
rocks of low altitude, and how many miles of
cliff fail to supply the three essential conditions
that we have been considering, we can see
that suitable breeding stations must be limited
both in number and extent. From a wide
expanse of ocean hosts of individuals are therefore
obliged to converge at certain definite
points; and hence, each recurring season, there
must arise a competition for positions at the
station, just as there is competition between
individual Buntings for positions in the marsh.
And the ability to obtain a position upon a
suitable ledge involves, in the first place,
an impulse to search for it; in the second
place, an impulse to dwell in it; and in the
third place, an impulse to resist intrusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
upon it. It would be useless for an individual
to be pugnacious if it had no fixed abode;
equally useless for it to establish itself on a
particular ledge if it had no power to defend it&mdash;all
of which implies an inherited nature similar
to that of the Bunting. But the proximate end
to which the competition is directed is not alike
in the case of both species. In the case of the
Guillemot it has reference solely to the piece of
rock whereon the egg is laid; in the case of the
Bunting to a piece of ground capable of furnishing
an adequate supply of food for the young;
and the reason for the difference is this, that
there is always an abundance of food in the
water beneath the cliff, but breeding stations are
scarce, whereas there is always an abundance of
situations in the marsh in which the Bunting
can place its nest, but the supply of food varies
and at times can only be obtained with
difficulty.</p>

<p>If then the Guillemot were to behave after
the manner of the Bunting and assign to itself a
portion of the face of the cliff, or if it were only
to occupy a few ledges, or an even lesser area&mdash;a
single ledge&mdash;what would be the result? That
it would attain to reproduction is beyond
question; that the egg would be safely deposited
there can be no manner of doubt; neither is
there any reason to suppose that the offspring
would not be successfully reared. But, indirectly,
its behaviour would affect the Guillemot
race. For if it be true, as the crowded ledges
certainly seem to show, that there is a dearth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
suitable breeding ground, no greater calamity
could befall the species than that some members
should exercise dominion over too large an area
of the habitable part of the cliff and thus
prevent others from breeding. Under such
conditions the race could not endure, since in
this, as in every case, its survival must depend
upon a close correspondence between the
behaviour of the individual and the circumstances
in the external environment.</p>

<p>Scarcity of suitable cliffs is the principal
reason of the ledges being so closely packed
with Guillemots, just as it accounts for this
part of the precipice being crowded with Kittiwake
Gulls, that part with Herring-Gulls, and
that part again with Razorbills and Puffins.
Yet each individual preserves its few square
feet of rock or soil from molestation, and the
area each one occupies varies according to the
conditions of existence of the species. Thus
the Herring-Gull occupies a comparatively small
area, although one many times larger than that
of the Guillemot. It requires more space than
the latter, owing to the fact that it not only
builds a nest but rears four instead of a single
offspring, and it can be allowed this, because,
since its young remain in the nest until they are
capable of sustained flight, it can make use of
many miles of cliff from which the tide recedes
at the base, or which have, at their base,
rocks jutting out into the sea; but manifestly
it cannot be allowed so much space as the
Bunting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>Martins build in close proximity to one
another, owing probably to shortage of accommodation,
and, in their case, the nests have to
be so situated as to be sheltered from the wet.
If water drips upon them for any length of
time, the mud, of which they are composed,
crumbles and large pieces fall away, with the
result that the eggs or the young are precipitated
to the ground. Consequently, not every
house or perpendicular cliff will answer the
purpose of a breeding station. A few pairs
build their nests beneath the eaves close against
the walls of my house, and year after year the
result is much the same; after every downfall
of rain, the water collects into rivulets, trickles
down over the eaves, is absorbed by the mud
and destroys the nests. Thereupon, the birds
set to work and rebuild; but again the nest is
destroyed, and again they rebuild, and so on
throughout the summer, and only on rare
occasions do they succeed in rearing offspring
at the proper season. Similar conditions must
prevail in many situations; but, clearly, the
more binding and plastic the building material,
the longer the nest will withstand the action of
the dripping water and the greater chance will
there be of the young being reared in safety.
Observe, therefore, how far-reaching an effect so
small a detail as the nature of the mud can have
upon the status of the species in any given
locality. Where the conditions are favourable,
there the birds must congregate to breed, and,
like the Guillemot, if each individual exercised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
dominion over too large an area, the species as
a whole would suffer.</p>

<p>In all these examples, the fact of different
individuals being in such close proximity may
afford some protection from enemies both as
regards the egg and the offspring, and in so far
as there is a mutual advantage such assemblages
may be spoken of as communities. A community,
however, in the true sense of the word,
is a collection of individuals brought together,
not primarily as a result of shortage of breeding
ground, but in consequence of advantages of
communal ownership over individual ownership.
A rookery is an example of a true community.
Neither shortage of nesting accommodation nor
scarcity of food can account for Rooks assembling
together to breed; for if the different
pairs which go to make up the rookery were to
scatter throughout the surrounding neighbourhood,
they would, as a rule, find plenty of trees
in which to build their nests, and plenty of food.</p>

<p>How, then, can the theory apply to a species
that breeds under such conditions? What part
can the territory play in furthering the life of
the individual when large numbers of nests are
built closely together in the same tree? There
is much evidence to show that mutual protection
is a necessary condition of the Rook's
existence; many cases are on record of rookeries
being destroyed by Carrion-Crows, Hooded
Crows, and Ravens. For instance, Mr. Ward
Fowler records a case in which a pair of Crows
attacked a small rookery, ransacked the nests,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and destroyed the eggs, with the result that not
a single pair of Rooks was left in the settlement.
Each Rook must therefore secure a position
within the precincts of the community if it is to
have a chance of success in the attainment of
reproduction. But every locality cannot supply
sufficient trees of the right kind, appropriately
situated and in suitable relation to the food
supply, in which numbers of nests can be built
in close proximity; so that if more than one
community were to attempt to establish itself in
a limited area, the supply of food or the supply
of trees might become a pressing problem.
Each community must therefore be prepared
to defend its own interests, and each must be
regarded as one unit and the area occupied
as one territory within which are included a
number of lesser territories. The individual
may fail to establish itself within a community,
but, even if it succeeds, the community may fail
to establish the rights of communal ownership;
hence it has to face a twofold possibility of
failure, and if it lacked the inherited nature
which leads the Guillemot to secure a position
upon the ledge, or the Bunting to obtain a
position in the marsh, the chances are that it
would fail in the attainment of reproduction.</p>

<p>The question now arises as to how it comes
about that the area occupied by each individual
conforms in broad outline to that which has
proved beneficial for the welfare of the species
as a whole. We shall find that up to a point
the answer is a simple one. No one could study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the behaviour of animals without observing the
important part that habit plays in the life of the
individual; an action performed to-day is liable
to be repeated to-morrow and the following day
until it becomes ingrained in the life of the
individual. This must not be taken to mean,
however, that a particular action has to be
performed for many days in succession before
it becomes definitely fixed; if only it is repeated
a number of times, even within the space of
a few hours, it will acquire sufficient strength
for its continuance; but continued repetition
gives increased fixity, and, as time goes by, it
becomes increasingly difficult for the creature to
make a change unless the character of the
situation necessitates readjustment.</p>

<p>For example, when the organic condition
which leads to nest-building becomes active,
the bird tentatively collects some of the
necessary material in its bill, flies round with
it, and then drops it. After a while it collects
some more, and this time leaves it perhaps in
a bush. Later on it makes another attempt,
and, meeting with a situation which calls forth
the appropriate response, it thereupon lays the
foundation of the structure. We will assume
that the nest is placed in the midst of a tangled
bush. Well, the bird lays the first strands of
the foundation and then goes in search of more
material. The next time it approaches the nest
from the opposite side of the bush, and presently
it finds yet a third entrance. But each entrance
is not made use of in turn: one is employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
more frequently than the other two, and in the
course of time becomes the sole highway to and
from the nest. Suppose now that, when the
young are hatched, I cut away the foliage from
the bush on the opposite side from that on
which the bird customarily enters, and by so
doing leave the nest exposed, what is the result?
The female arrives with food, threads her way
through the bush, and, when beside the nest,
pauses as if aware that some change had taken
place, and then flies away through the new
opening. In a short time she returns, flits from
twig to twig on the outskirts of the bush,
and comes upon the new opening&mdash;there she
hesitates. But though the nest is in full view
and within a few inches of her perch, and though
the young stretch out their necks, yet so strong
is the former habit that she is compelled to
return to the opposite side and approach the
nest by the usual circuitous route before she
distributes the food amongst her offspring.</p>

<p>Let us see how far this law of habit
formation may have been effective in defining
the extent of the area occupied. When a male
Warbler arrives at its destination in the spring
it seeks out a suitable environment, and, having
found a place unoccupied by any other male,
settles in it and remains there&mdash;its behaviour
up to this point being determined by racial
preparation. After the fatigue of the journey
its movements are at first sluggish; hunger,
however, asserts itself and a search is made for
food; wandering away from the position in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
which it first settled and which acts as a headquarters,
it hunts through certain trees here or
certain bushes there and returns, and presently
it wanders away again, perhaps in another
direction, but, as before, works its way back
again to the headquarters. The journeys thus
radiate outwards from the headquarters, and
according to the success with which the bird
meets, so, probably, it happens that some trees
are searched more often than others and certain
directions are taken more frequently than others,
and by constant repetition a routine is established
which limits the direction and scope of its
wanderings.</p>

<p>But in the case of the Guillemot the
conditions of existence are reversed: food can
be had in abundance but suitable breeding
stations are scarce. The few square feet of
ledge correspond to the tree or clump of bushes
which acts as a headquarters for the Warbler,
and the occupation of them is determined, as
it is in the case of the Warbler, by racial
preparation. Since, however, the ledge is only
made use of for the immediate purpose of
incubation and is in no way affected by
questions relating to food, there is no occasion
for the bird to wander along the ledge nor to
encroach upon those adjoining. Hunger stimulates
the Warbler to search the surrounding
trees, and so to extend its area; but hunger
takes the Guillemot down to the water, and
hence the area which it primarily occupied
remains unmodified.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>To sum up: the territory is useful in various
ways, but not necessarily in the same way
for every species. Reproduction would always
have remained fortuitous, and the number of
individuals that attained to it would seldom
have reached the possible maximum unless some
provision had been included in its system for
insuring that the males and females could meet
at the proper moment and afterwards remain in
touch with one another, and that the number of
pairs inhabiting a given area did not exceed the
available means of support. I have tried to
show that the inclusion of a disposition to secure
a territory tends to remove these difficulties.
In the first place, the disposition which leads to
its occupation comes into functional activity (in
the male) early in the season; and so, by the
time that the appropriate pairing condition
arises in the females, the process of acquiring
territories is well advanced, and the males being
regularly distributed, each in its respective
position, are readily found by their prospective
mates. The behaviour of each sex is thus
adjusted to further the end of mutual discovery.
Next, after mating has taken place, the position
occupied by the male acts as a headquarters to
which the birds can always repair, and becomes
a bond of union which is serviceable in that it
prevents any possibility of their drifting apart.
And in the third place, the males become
pugnacious and in this way secure for themselves
areas which vary in size according to the
conditions of existence of the species, so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
there is no possibility of too many congregating
in this locality, and all the less likelihood of too
few finding their way to that; and hence, on the
average, different pairs are distributed throughout
all suitable localities. Furthermore, owing
to the fact of their having a headquarters, the
male and female are allowed a freedom of
movement which otherwise they would only
possess when the construction of the nest had
actually begun; they can seek their food
independently, and, even though paired, they
can if necessary continue their winter routine
without risk of separation. This means that the
organic condition which leads to pairing, is free
to develop in the female earlier than would be
the case if there were nothing in the external
environment to attract the pair to a particular
spot; and the longer the period over which the
process of pairing can be spread, the greater
chance will females have of discovering mates,
the less severe will the competition tend to
become, and, consequently, the smaller the
percentage of individuals that fail to obtain
suitable partners.</p>

<p>In these ways the territory has been serviceable
alike to a number of species. But much
as the questions of mutual discovery and regular
distribution may have influenced the course of
its development, there can, I think, be little
doubt that, on the one hand, the supply of
the necessary accommodation for rearing offspring,
and on the other, the necessity for an
adequate supply of food in close proximity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the nest, have been the main determining factors,
and have led to a wide divergence in its function.
At the one extreme the function is to insure
a plentiful supply of food for the young; at the
other, to insure a station suitable for rearing
offspring. I took the Bunting and the Guillemot
as types of the two extremes. The young of
the former species are born in a very helpless
state. They are susceptible to cold and unable
to withstand prolonged exposure, and therefore
it is essential that there should be an ample
supply of food, upon which the parents can
draw liberally, in the vicinity of the nest. But
the nest is placed in a variety of situations, and
accommodation in this respect may be said to
be unlimited. The young of the latter species
are not so susceptible to exposure, and moreover
there is always an abundance of food in the
waters beneath the cliff; but ledges of rock,
upon which the egg can be securely deposited
and the young successfully reared, are limited
both in number and extent. The position then
is as follows: there are situations in plenty in
which hosts of Buntings can build their nests
but the supply of food is a difficulty, and if the
respective areas of different individuals were
insufficient to supply them with the necessary
food with the necessary rapidity, they would
run the risk of losing their offspring and the
species would not endure; on the other hand,
cliffs upon which the Guillemot can rear its
young are limited, but the supply of food
presents no difficulty, and consequently the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
smaller the area over which each individual
exercises dominion, the greater the number
that will attain to reproduction and the greater
prospect the species will have of survival. The
emphasis in the one case lies on the fact that
the area occupied must be sufficiently large;
on the other, on its being just sufficient and
no more to accommodate the egg. Hence
the difference in the function at the opposite
extremes is brought about, not by modifications
of the instinctive behaviour which leads to the
establishment and defence of the territory, but
solely by modifications in the size of the area
occupied, in accordance with the conditions
prevailing in the external environment. No
doubt, if we had the life-histories of a sufficient
number of species worked out, we should find
that the gradations were complete from the
one extreme to the other. We are justified
in thinking that this must be so because in
many directions we can not only observe
differences in the size of the area occupied, but
can recognise a close correspondence between
those differences and the conditions of life of
the species. Thus the Herring-Gull occupies
a comparatively small area, though one which
is many times larger than that of the Guillemot.
It requires more space because it not only builds
a nest but rears four instead of a single offspring,
and it can be allowed more space because the
young remain in the nest until they are capable
of sustained flight, and consequently it can
make use of many miles of cliff from which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
tide recedes at the base, and which on this
account are denied to the Guillemot, but
manifestly it cannot be allowed so much space
as the Bunting, for then comparatively few
individuals would attain to reproduction.</p>

<p>Again, the Reed-Warbler inhabits swamps
overgrown with the common reed, and in such
places insect life is abundant just at the
time when the young are hatched. But these
swamps cover a comparatively small acreage in
the breeding range of the bird, and if each pair
were to attempt to establish dominion over an
area equal, let us say, to that of the Willow-Warbler,
the species would have but a poor
chance in the struggle for existence. So that,
in a case of this description, the supply of food
and the comparative scarcity of breeding stations
have been factors of like importance in the
evolution of the territory.</p>

<p>Finally we were led to inquire as to how
it comes about that the extent of the area
occupied by each individual is adapted to the
circumstances in which the individual finds
itself; and we came to the conclusion that the
movements of the bird, subsequent to the
initial act of establishing itself in a position,
are regulated and defined by the law of habit
formation. For example, the Warbler, in
response to its inherited nature, takes up a
position in an appropriate situation. It then
proceeds to search for food; it makes short
journeys first in this direction and then in
that; it repeats these journeys, and gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
forms a habit which compels it to remain
within more or less well-defined boundaries.
But the actual distance that it traverses on
the occasion of its first attempt must be determined
by the relative abundance or scarcity
of the particular kind of insect life which it
requires. So that, although habit defines and
in some measure helps to determine the
boundaries of the territory, it is clear that in
the last resort they must depend upon the
nature of the conditions in the external
environment.</p>

<p>We have, then, the congenital basis which
leads to the occupation of a position, and to
the enmity shown by the owner of the position
towards other individuals; and this congenital
basis is found alike in many widely divergent
forms, living under equally widely divergent conditions;
we have acquired accommodation; and
we have relationships in the organic and inorganic
world&mdash;and the outcome of it all is a system
of behaviour which we, who can perceive the
end to which such behaviour is tending, are
justified in speaking of as "a disposition to
secure a territory." In the development of
this system a primary value must be ascribed
to the conditions in the external environment,
for they determine the direction of the variations
of instinctive procedure and of acquired habit
which work towards the same goal&mdash;that of
adjustment to the conditions of life.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>


<p class="tb2">The following are the experiments referred to on
page 181:&mdash;</p>


<p class="tb2">On the 14th May 1915, a nest of Blackbirds approximately
four days old was removed at 6.45 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> The
temperature was considerably below the normal, and snow
lay on all the high ground in the neighbourhood. In a
short time the birds collapsed, and at 9.15 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> were dead.
On the 29th May, at 6 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span>, a second nest was removed,
containing young of approximately the same age, and
although the conditions were more normal, the temperature
being 50&deg; F., the birds collapsed at 8 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span>, and an
hour later one of the brood showed little signs of life.
The wind, however, then changed to the west, and the
temperature rose one degree, with the result that they
were still living at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M</span>. A further experiment was
made with Song-Thrushes on the 5th June. The wind was
in the south and the temperature 63&deg; F. The young,
approximately four days old, were removed at 7.25 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span>,
but as they showed no signs of collapse at 1 <span class="smcaplc">P.M.</span> I replaced
the nest in the original site.</p>


<p class="tb2">On the 30th May, a nest of Whitethroats three days
old was removed at 7.15 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> The wind was northerly
and the weather fine, but the temperature low&mdash;50&deg; F.
At 8.15 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span> the birds showed no sign of life. A second
experiment with this species was made on the 10th June
under more favourable circumstances, for although the
sky was overcast and the wind northerly, the temperature
was 59&deg; F. In this case the young survived from 6.55 <span class="smcaplc">A.M.</span>
to 7 <span class="smcaplc">P.M.</span></p>


<p class="tb2">On the 27th May 1915, a nest of Hedge-Sparrows

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE WARFARE BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES
AND ITS RELATION TO THE TERRITORY</h4>


<p>We have now considered the various ways in
which the territory is useful in furthering the
life of the individual. We have seen that, in
some cases, there is competition for stations
where the egg or eggs can be deposited and
incubated in safety; that, in others, there is
competition for stations capable of furnishing
an adequate supply of food for the young;
and that the establishment of "territories"
not only renders the attainment of reproduction
for the individual secure, but serves so to
regulate the distribution of pairs that the
maximum number can be accommodated in
the minimum area. This being so, the question
arises as to whether competition for territory
is strictly limited to individuals of the same
species, or whether it may not occur also
between different kinds of birds, providing
always that similar conditions of existence
are required. First of all I shall relate a
number of facts which will serve to show the
nature and extent of the warfare, and I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
then give the reasons which lead me to believe
that the fighting not only bears some relation
to the "territory," but that it is an important
factor in contributing to the attainment of that
which for biological interpretation is the end
for which the whole territorial system has been
evolved.</p>

<p>Those who have studied wild life on one of
the rocky headlands, which are so numerous
round our coasts, will probably be familiar with
the rivalry that exists between the Raven and
certain birds of prey. Where the Raven finds
shelter for its nest, there, too, the Peregrine
has its eyrie&mdash;and so it happens that these two
species are continually at war. Now the warfare
occurs not only during the season of
reproduction but continues throughout the
greater part of the year, and can even be
observed in the late summer or early autumn&mdash;the
period when we should expect to find the
instinct least susceptible to appropriate stimulation.
But it is of a more determined kind
early in the spring, and it is then that we often
witness those remarkable exhibitions of flight,
the skill of which excites our admiration. The
Falcon rises above the Raven, stoops at it, and
when it seems no longer possible for a collision
to be avoided, or, one would imagine, for the
Raven to escape destruction, the Raven skilfully
turns upon its back and momentarily faces its
opponent, and the Falcon with equal skill
changes its course, passing upwards and away.
The attack, however, is soon repeated, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
though no collision may actually take place, yet
the fact that the Raven, when it turns to face
its adversary, is obliged to drop the stick which
it carries, is not only an indication of the
character of the struggle, but it shows that a
definite end is gained&mdash;that the efforts of the
Raven to build in that particular locality are
hampered. But the Falcon is not the only
enemy that the Raven has to face; Buzzards
are just as intolerant of the presence of Ravens
in their neighbourhood as the Ravens are of
them, and consequently there is incessant
quarrelling wherever the same locality is
inhabited. As a rule, the fighting occurs whilst
the birds are on the wing; the Buzzard rises to
a considerable height, and, closing its wings,
stoops at the Raven below, and when within a
short distance of its adversary, swerves upwards
and gains a position from which it can again
attack. The Buzzard, however, is by no means
always the aggressor; I have watched one so
persistently harassed by a Raven that at length
it left the rock upon which it was resting and
disappeared from view, still followed by its rival.
Thus it seems as if they were evenly matched,
and, when they occupy the same locality, it is
interesting to notice how the initiative passes
from the one to the other according to the
position occupied by the birds in their respective
territories.</p>

attacking a Raven" title="Peregrine Falcon attacking a Raven." /></div>

<p>That there is constant warfare between the
Green Woodpecker and the Starling is well
known, the purpose of the Starling being to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
gain possession of the hole which the Woodpecker
with much skill has drilled for itself.
As far as my experience goes, the Starling is
always the aggressor, and there is only too good
reason to fear that, in the course of time, the
Green Woodpecker will disappear as a result of
the greater fertility and tenacity of its enemy.
The Martin suffers a similar kind of persecution
from the House-Sparrow, and here again there
is reason to believe that the greater virility of
the Sparrow will hasten the extinction of its
rival. In cases of this description the purpose of
the fighting is clear, and one can understand
why such divergent species should be hostile to
one another; yet others, equally remote in the
scale of nature, are hostile when no such
ostensible reason can be assigned for their
hostility. Few birds are more pugnacious than
the Moor-Hen, and the determined manner
in which different individuals fight with one
another is notorious. But the intolerance it
displays towards other species is no less remarkable,
and its pugnacious instinct seems to be
peculiarly susceptible to stimulation by different
individuals belonging to widely divergent forms.
At one moment a Lapwing may be attacked,
at another a Thrush or a Starling, harmless
strangers that have approached the pool to
drink; even a Water-Rail, as it threads its way
through the rushes, may fail to escape detection;
and, which is still more curious, a covey
of Partridges will evoke response if they
approach the pool too closely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>Here is a curious instance of apparent waste
of energy. A pair of Magpies built their nest
in an ilex tree. Early one morning there was
a commotion in the tree, much flapping of
wings and a medley of sounds which told of
large birds engaged in a struggle&mdash;the Magpies
were attacking a pair of Wood-Pigeons. There
was no question as to the genuineness of the
struggle, nor any doubt as to the proximate end
for which the Magpies were striving, for their
efforts continued so long as the Wood-Pigeons
remained in the tree, and only ceased when they
had succeeded in driving them away.</p>

<p>Turning next to species which are less
distantly related, we find that instances of
intolerance are more numerous and that a wider
range of species is involved. The hostility that
the Lapwing displays towards the Snipe calls
for special remark. It often happens that the
marshes or water meadows, that are such
favourite haunts of the Lapwing, are also
resorted to by Snipe for the purpose of securing
food, or it may be even for the purpose of
reproduction. In such places both species are
often abundant; the meadow is divided up into
Lapwings' territories, and early in the season the
Snipe wander over it in small parties, singly, or
in pairs. Now, if it were only on isolated
occasions that the Lapwing paid heed to the
Snipe, one would not perhaps attach any
peculiar significance to the fact; but the
pugnacious instinct of the bird responds to the
presence of this intruder almost as freely as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
does to that of another Lapwing. Again and
again, day after day, the Snipe are attacked and
driven off in a manner which would be fittingly
described as persistent persecution, for the Snipe
has neither the physical capacity nor apparently
any instinctive tendency to retaliate. Thus a
Lapwing may come suddenly upon a small
party of Snipe hidden from view in a dyke
where they are probing the ground for food;
the Snipe immediately rise and fly away and
there is momentary confusion as the Lapwing
darts first at this one, then at that; or, espying
a Snipe at rest at the opposite end of its
territory, it will first of all run rapidly towards
it, and then fly after it, as, with twisting flight,
it darts hither and thither a few feet above the
ground; or again, it will attack and rapidly
pursue solitary individuals as they skim across
its territory and attempt to settle. Is this
intolerance merely an exuberant expression of
an instinct which is serviceable in another
direction? The behaviour of the Lapwing
scarcely justifies such a conclusion, for all its
actions denote a striving towards some end
which we can describe, and it seems to gain
satisfaction only when the ejection of the
intruder has been accomplished.</p>

<p>Many of the Warblers display irritation
when approached by other birds which we
should scarcely expect would arouse their
hostility. The Hedge-Sparrow, for example, is
frequently regarded with suspicion, and it is
by no means unusual to see it attacked by so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
small a bird as the Chiffchaff. The Wood-Warbler
is also pugnacious, and will even attack
a pair of Chaffinches. Between the Tit family
and some of the smaller Warblers there are
constant exhibitions of hostility; even the Great
Tit is liable to be driven away, but the Blue
Tit is especially marked out for persecution,
though doubtless it is well able to hold its own.</p>

<p>The following incident will show how real is
the antagonism between these two families.
A Chiffchaff occupied the corner of a small
osier bed, and was particularly aggressive
towards other closely-related forms in its
immediate neighbourhood. On two mornings
in succession ten Blue Tits invaded its ground,
passing from end to end of it as they wended
their way from tree to tree in search of food.
Their presence evoked the usual hostile response,
yet, withal, aroused the fear of the Chiffchaff,
which, at times, appeared to be swayed by
conflicting impulses. Now, in attempting to
interpret the nature of the instinct which was
evoked, one has to be guided, in a case of this
description, by the similarity of the response to
that which can be observed on other occasions
and in other situations when the intention of
the bird is clear. And on this occasion the
Chiffchaff betrayed all the symptoms which
normally precede an attack; it spread its tail,
quivered its wings, uttered its high-pitched note
rapidly, hopped from twig to twig, or flew
restlessly from tree to tree, and seemed to be
prevented from attacking only by the number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of its opponents. This, indeed, was shown by
its subsequent behaviour, for whenever a Tit
became temporarily detached from its companions
it hesitated no longer but forthwith
attacked.</p>

<p>There are other species which are no less
aggressive than the Warblers&mdash;the Chats for
example. The Stonechat regards with suspicion
almost any bird of its own size, and will even
pursue a Tree-Pipit if it approaches too closely.
The same is true of the Whinchat, and one
would scarcely expect to find this bird attacking
Buntings as it sometimes does. A Whinchat
that occupied some marshy ground was constantly
at war with a pair of Reed-Buntings;
their territories were adjacent and in some
measure overlapped, and the Whinchat drove
away either sex indiscriminately, and was not
only always the aggressor but seemed to be
master of the situation.</p>

<p>Coming now to kindred forms, those, that
is to say, which belong to the same family, we
find that, both in intensity and extent, the
warfare far exceeds anything that we have thus
far considered. So frequent, indeed, are acts
of intolerance, and so readily awakened into
activity is the pugnacious nature of the bird,
that the fighting will almost bear comparison
in volume with that which occurs between
individuals of the same species. Between the
Thrush and the Blackbird there are incessant
quarrels early in the year, and the initiative
seems to pass from one to the other according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the circumstances in which they are placed. If
the territory of a Thrush is invaded the Thrush
is the aggressor, and, conversely, if that of the
Blackbird is threatened, the Blackbird becomes
the aggressor; and so, when the territories of the
two birds are adjacent or overlap, as frequently
they do, there is constant friction, resulting in
quarrels which attract attention on account of
the noisiness of the birds.</p>

<p>All the Warblers are exceedingly pugnacious,
the fighting being especially severe between
those that are very closely related. The Blackcap
and the Garden-Warbler are constant rivals,
and the scenes which can be witnessed when
the two meet in competition are interesting
from many points of view. The birds not only
pursue and fight with one another, but their
emotional behaviour reaches a high level of
intensity&mdash;excitable outbursts of song are indulged
in, tails are outspread, wings are slowly
flapped, and feathers raised&mdash;in fact the attitudes
assumed are similar in all respects to those
which occur during the contests which are so
frequent between the respective individuals of
each species; and it would be difficult to point
to any one item of behaviour which is not
also manifest at one time or another during the
battles between these rivals, and still more
difficult to trace any difference in the intensity
of the excitement. And if we are satisfied that
the fighting in the one case is purposive, so, too,
must we regard it as having some biological
purpose to serve in the other. But the Garden-Warbler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
is not the only bird that acts as a
stimulus to the instinct of the Blackcap;
Whitethroats are often attacked, and the Chiffchaff
is a source of irritation. Even when a
male Blackcap is engaged in incubation, it will
leave its nest on the approach of a Chiffchaff,
and, having driven away the intruder, proceed
to sing excitedly. At other times both male
and female will combine to attack this small
intruder.</p>

<p>But this does not mean that the Chiffchaff
suffers persecution; it is itself most aggressive,
as is shown by the fact that it will join in the
Blackcap quarrels and attack the combatants
indiscriminately. Its behaviour, however, requires
further consideration, especially as regards
its relations with its nearest of kin&mdash;the Willow-Warbler;
for here we have a mutual intolerance
which is somewhat remarkable, and evidence of
it can be found wherever the birds occupy the
same ground. Now it can be observed that the
hostility is not limited merely to occasional acts
of intolerance, but that there is organised
warfare lasting, it may be, for many days in
succession, and that the actions of the birds bear
the stamp of a persistent striving towards some
end. On one occasion the Willow-Warbler
may be the aggressor, on another the Chiffchaff,
and at times it is difficult to say which of
the two is responsible for the quarrel. In size
and in strength they are equal, and the "will to
fight" is as strong in the one as in the other, so
that it is seldom, if ever, possible to point to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
this one as the victor and that one as the
vanquished. Success or failure probably depends
more upon the cumulative effect of many
combats entailing physical exhaustion, than
upon the issue of any one particular battle; and
whilst observation might quite well fail to
distinguish any resultant change in the relative
positions of the birds, or any harmful effect
upon their constitutions, yet the area occupied
by this one might be sufficiently curtailed to
prejudice the welfare of the young, or the
vitality of that one might be seriously impaired&mdash;and
we should be none the wiser.</p>

<p>Neither the Marsh-Warbler nor the Reed-Warbler
will tolerate strangers within the small
space of ground over which they exercise
dominion. Of the two, the Marsh-Warbler is
perhaps the more pugnacious, and will attack
any other Warbler that approaches too closely;
Whitethroats are often pursued and driven
away, and less frequently, Garden-Warblers.
In one case, a male occupied the same ground
as a Sedge-Warbler, and there was a constant
feud between them; a willow-tree formed its
headquarters, and this same tree seemed to be
the headquarters of the Sedge-Warbler, so that
they often met and whenever they did so they
quarrelled. As a rule the Marsh-Warbler was
the aggressor and had the mastery over its
opponent, and when it attacked, it uttered a
peculiar harsh scolding note, raised the feathers
on its back, spread out its wings, and betrayed
the usual symptoms of emotional excitement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>On the other hand, the Sedge-Warbler is
most aggressive towards other kindred species,
and when a male happens to occupy the same
ground as a Reed-Warbler, there are frequent
battles between them and incessant commotion;
they fly at one another and meet in the air with
an audible clicking of bills, or pursue one
another amongst the reeds, each one uttering
its characteristic scolding note.</p>

<p>The Tits, as a family, are notoriously
pugnacious. I have seen a pair of Blue Tits
attack a single Long-tailed Tit with great
determination, and not only did they pursue it,
but, flying at it, struck it with considerable
force.</p>

<p>In giving an account of the domestic
economy of the Carrion-Crow, Mr. Edmund
Selous refers to the hostility between this bird
and the Magpie. "About a week ago," he
says,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> "I saw a Crow busily engaged in chasing
away several Magpies, not only from three or
four tall slender trees close together, in one of
which it had its nest, but also from various
other trees, not far off, round about. In this
the Crow had a good deal of trouble, as the
Magpies were always returning. After a time
it was joined by another crow, which however
did not take so active a part in the drama, nor
did I see either of the two actually go to the
nest, though I could only explain their action by
supposing it was their own. This morning I
saw the same thing reversed, for a pair of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Magpies, with an undoubted nest, kept attacking
a Crow that insisted on settling in one of a row
of trees&mdash;also tall and slender&mdash;in which it was
placed. Both were equally persevering&mdash;the
Crow, though often chased away, always
returning, and settling generally in the last
tree of the row, where he would be left alone
sometimes for a minute or two, but before long
one of the Magpies flew at him, and put him to
flight. The Crow defended itself, but not, it
would seem, very successfully, and in the last
attack upon him, made, with great spirit, in the
air, a large black feather floated to the ground,
which I made no doubt was his. Yet this did
not drive him from the trees, and it was only on
my approaching nearer that he finally left them.
Thus we see that both species look upon the
approach of the other to within a moderate
distance of their nest as an intrusion."</p>

<p>That the Rook suffers persecution from
the Carrion-Crow is a well-established fact,
and there is reason to believe that it has
another dangerous enemy in the Hooded Crow.
According to the late Mr. Ussher, Choughs will
attack both Hooded Crows and Ravens. "I
once saw," he says, "two Choughs energetically
attacking a pair of Ravens; they shot up into
the air and darted down on the latter, whose
heavy flight made them helpless against their
agile tormentors."</p>

<p>Birds of prey are often hostile to one another.
The Merlin is exceptionally pugnacious, and its
boldness in attacking intruders is well known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
When, for example, a Kestrel approaches its
territory, it leaves the tree, bush, or rock upon
which it was resting, utters its characteristic
cry, and soars rapidly upwards; then, rising to
a considerable height, it swoops down upon the
Kestrel, and by alternately stooping at and
chasing its opponent, drives it away from the
immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>What we have, then, to consider is, Do these
battles between different species contribute
towards the attainment of the end for which
the whole territorial system has been evolved?</p>

<p>Let us take the individual and see whether
we can establish any relation between the
hostility it displays towards members of other
species and its general disposition to secure
a territory. We must remember that a male
can have no knowledge of the prospective
value of its behaviour, nor is it likely that it
has any ulterior purpose in ejecting other males,
beyond the pleasure it derives from satisfying
its impulse to do so. The proximate end of
its behaviour is to attack, nothing more, and
this, of course, it can only do just in so far
as the intruder evokes the appropriate instinct.</p>

<p>Now the arguments we shall employ will,
on the whole, be similar to those which we
made use of in the second chapter, wherein
we attempted to ascertain the conditions under
which a male becomes intolerant of other
males of its own species, and examined more
especially the claims of the "territory" as
opposed to those of the "female." But here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
we start on firmer ground, because the one
factor which introduced an element of uncertainty&mdash;the
female&mdash;can be definitely excluded;
at least it seems so to me, for granting even
that her presence is the condition under which
the pugnacious nature of the male is rendered
susceptible to stimulation, it is difficult to see
why a male of a different species should supply
that stimulus, or what biological purpose could
be served by its doing so.</p>

<p>When dealing with the attitude of a male
towards others of its kind, we attached considerable
significance to the fact that its pugnacious
nature gained or lost susceptibility according
to the position which it happened to occupy.
We found, it will be remembered, that the
same bird that was pugnacious in its own
territory took no further interest in its opponent
when the boundary was passed; and, moreover,
that if it happened to wander into an adjoining
one, it made no real effort to defend itself
when attacked, but returned forthwith to its
own headquarters. It remains to be shown
whether the rivalry between different kinds of
birds is similarly related to the position which
the opponents happen to occupy at the time.</p>

<p>First, then, there is the general consideration,
namely, that the enmity occurs for the most
part just at the time when the territories are
in process of being established. During autumn
and winter, many birds of more or less close
affinity assemble together in flocks, wherever
the supply of food is abundant, and are then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
not only sociable, but, so there is reason to
believe, are mutually helpful both in discovering
the necessary means of subsistence which are
often none too plentiful, and in affording protection
from enemies, which, on the contrary,
are often numerous. That the different units
of which these flocks are composed should live
on amicable terms is therefore as necessary
for the welfare of the whole community at
this particular season as that the different
individuals of the same species should do so.
But just as the sociable relations, which obtain
between these individuals throughout the winter,
undergo a marked change at the commencement
of the breeding season, so, too, do different
species, which habitually associate together,
suddenly become hostile to one another. This
change is coincident in time with the rise of
the organic condition which leads to the
establishment of territories; and the hostility
continues, though in diminishing degree,
throughout the breeding season, and dies away
the following autumn.</p>

<p>For example, different Warblers resort to
the elders (<i>Sambucus nigra</i>) in September, and
there pass much time feeding on the fruit which
is then ripe and often abundant. In the same
bush there may be Blackcaps, Garden-Warblers,
Whitethroats, and Lesser Whitethroats, some
preening their feathers, others searching for
the berries, others again, with feathers relaxed,
making feeble attempts to sing. Occasionally
there may be a scuffle, perhaps between a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Blackcap and a Lesser Whitethroat, or between
a Garden-Warbler and a Blackcap, but it is
of short duration and lacks vigour. Apart,
however, from such temporary disturbances,
there is no real rupture in their relations, and
certainly nothing to lead one to suppose that
the bickerings are determined by the functioning
of any specific instinct. Yet only a few months
previously some of them were constantly at
war, and their quarrels betrayed symptoms of
great persistence; and if we remember how
the observed behaviour of the birds suggests
the fact that they were striving to attain something
definite, we shall understand the nature
and extent of the change, and shall, I fancy,
be in a better position to estimate its biological
worth at its true value.</p>

<p>We can find many similar examples&mdash;flocks
are to be found on arable ground, on the water
meadows, and on the mud-flats; here different
kinds of Thrushes feed on the berries of the
yew, there different kinds of Tits travel together
in parties; hosts of Finches collect in the hollies
to pass the night and Buntings roost together
in the gorse; and, in fact, in whatever direction
we choose to look in the autumn and winter,
we find various birds assembled together and
living on amicable terms. All of this changes
in the spring, and the relationship undergoes
a gradual but noticeable alteration; so much
so that whereas the outstanding feature of bird
life in the winter is sociability, that of the
spring is hostility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>So much, then, for the seasonal change of
relationship; let us now turn to particular cases
and attempt to trace the condition which
accompanies such change.</p>

<p>Many migrants in the spring seem to follow
the course of the Severn during their journey
northwards through Worcestershire; and where
the river bends to the north-west at Lincombe
Lock, there they leave it, or, rather, continue
in a north-easterly direction which takes them
across the southern end of Hartlebury Common.
As I have already mentioned, this Common is
overgrown with gorse, heather, and ling, and
scattered here and there are a number of dwarf
oak-trees and small elder-bushes. The situation
is therefore an ideal one for the smaller migrants
to rest for a brief time, and, from the point of
view of the observer, very suitable because it is
open and the movements of the birds can be
traced for some distance. Turtle Doves pass
over at a great height, or skim across a few
feet above the gorse; Redstarts settle for a
few minutes and then disappear; Tree-Pipits,
Whinchats, and Willow-Warblers pass from
tree to tree or flit from bush to bush&mdash;and all
in a north-easterly direction. They do not
sing, they are restless, and, judging by their
behaviour, they are anxious to conceal their
presence, not to make it known. Yet we know
that when they reach their destination, as
presently they will, all this will change; that
each of them will employ every means at its
disposal to make itself conspicuous; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
each, as far as it is able, will resist intrusion on
the part of other species.</p>

<p>Now the southern end of the Common is
always inhabited by individuals belonging to
one of these species, or to others of close
affinity; so that wherever these travellers settle
whilst passing across it, the chances are that
they will find the ground occupied&mdash;and their
behaviour under such circumstances is no less
interesting than the behaviour of the bird upon
whose ground they are trespassing. We will
take the case of the Whinchat. It arrives from
the south-west, and, flying from bush to bush,
works its way in a north-easterly direction. In
doing so it intrudes upon the territory of
a Stonechat; and the Stonechat, becoming
excited, flies towards it, and it retires for a short
distance in the direction from whence it came.
Here again it is followed and attacked and
again moves on, and then, flying in a circle as if
to avoid the territory which blocked the path,
resumes its former line of flight, though still
followed by the Stonechat, which after continuing
the pursuit for perhaps a quarter of a mile,
suddenly turns in the air and returns to its
headquarters.</p>

<p>It is difficult to put oneself in the place of
the Stonechat or of the Whinchat. But even
after making due allowance for the danger
inseparable from any attempt to do so, there
remains the unquestionable fact that whereas
the impulse to attack was strong in the one, the
impulse to defend itself was wholly lacking in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
the other. Yet a Whinchat, when it has
established itself, is most pugnacious; it not
only attacks every bird of a similar size that
approaches its position, but its behaviour under
such circumstances bears the impress of unusual
determination; and if we were to take a male
and place it in the position of the Stonechat, we
should find that its nature would change, that
the presence of the Stonechat would evoke a
hostile response, and, conversely, that the
instinct of the Stonechat would not be susceptible
to stimulation. Hence it is clear that the
nature of a bird when on migration is not quite
the same as it is when its destination is reached;
that the positions occupied from time to time
during the journey carry no meaning, or, rather,
are not brought into relation with its life in
quite the same way as is the position which it
finally occupies; and further, it is clear that the
interest it displays in other species undergoes a
somewhat remarkable transformation when at
length its destination is reached.</p>

<p>This altered nature of the migrant is a fact
of some importance in relation to our present
subject, but it does not stand alone&mdash;the same
characteristic is observable in other phases of
bird life. Some of the residents, the Buntings
and the Finches for example, occupy their
breeding ground very early in the year, and it
often happens that the situations which they
select are not capable of supplying them with
food so early in the season, though at a later
date food will be there in abundance; so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
they are compelled to resort to the surrounding
neighbourhood, and since, even there, the
available supply is sometimes scarce or, if
plentiful, limited to certain areas, they are
constrained from time to time to join together
again in flocks. Thus, for part of the year,
they may be said to lead a double existence;
for just as the Whinchat, that is sociable on
migration, betrays a changed nature when it
reaches its destination, so too does the nature
of these residents change from hour to hour
according to whether they are seeking food or
occupying the breeding ground.</p>

<p>In the newly-sown fields of grain the birds
frequently find a supply of food. Here Yellow
Buntings, Greenfinches, and Chaffinches collect
from the surrounding neighbourhood. The
majority are somewhere in possession of territories,
and not a few are paired. Between the
territories and the feeding ground a highway is
formed by individuals passing to and fro.
Sometimes both members of the pair leave
together in order to seek food, at other times
they separate and the male may be in his
territory whilst the female is with the flock.
Apart from occasional manifestations of sexual
emotion on the part of a male, there is nothing
to disturb the harmony of the flock nor anything
in the behaviour of the birds which would
lead one to suspect that, when they return, their
nature will change and that they will be no
longer sociable; and, which is still more remarkable,
no matter how great the provocation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
an individual, when in company with the flock,
may be called upon to endure, its customary
hostile response will fail to be elicited. An
incident which happened in the spring of 1917
will serve to make this clear. A flock of some
thirty Yellow Buntings, Greenfinches, and
Chaffinches were feeding in one corner of a
field which had recently been sown with barley.
As they sought their food they wandered
outwards into the middle of the field, and in
so doing, passed across the territory of a Skylark.
Whereupon the Skylark became excited,
uttered its call-note rapidly, and rising a few
feet from the ground, attacked those members
of the flock that were nearest, which happened
to be the Yellow Buntings; and so determined
were its onslaughts that the Yellow Buntings
were forced to retire. The Skylark showed no
discrimination as to sex, but attacked both males
and females, and within a few minutes succeeded
in driving away at least two pairs. One would
have expected that the Yellow Buntings would
have made some show of resistance; one would
have thought that the fact of being violently
attacked would have supplied a stimulus
sufficiently strong to evoke a corresponding
hostile response: yet there was no mistaking
the lack of interest that they displayed in the
contest&mdash;they made no effort to retaliate but
seemed to accept the situation as unalterable
and left.</p>

<p>So far we have examined only those cases in
which the pugnacious instinct was stimulated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
one of the adversaries, and in which consequently
the fighting seldom reached any high degree of
severity. We must now consider some others
in which each of the opponents acts as a
stimulus to the pugnacious instinct of the other.
It is here, of course, that we find the most
violently contested battles, and it is here, too,
that the purpose of the fighting seems clear.
The persecution which the Green Woodpecker
suffers from the Starling is well known. The
purpose of the Starling's behaviour is clear,
namely the possession of the hole occupied
by the Woodpecker. Bird for bird, the Woodpecker
is more than the equal of the Starling,
but persistent endeavour ultimately wins the
day. The Starlings perch close beside the hole,
and, whenever the Woodpecker shows itself,
attack with determination; and not only do
they do so but they are assisted, so there is
reason to believe, by other individuals or pairs
in the attainment of their end, so that no matter
how stoutly the Woodpecker defends itself, in
time it is almost certain to be deprived of its
ownership.</p>

<p>In like manner different kinds of Woodpeckers
contend with one another for the
possession of a hole, and here the opponents
are more equally matched. I have seen a pair
of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers endeavouring
to drive away a Great Spotted Woodpecker.
The excitement of all three birds was exceptional.
Each of the Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers kept
swooping in turn at their rival, sometimes in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
air and sometimes when it was settled on the
topmost branches of a dead tree, and the sounds
produced reminded one of the piping of a flock
of Oyster-Catchers in flight.</p>

<p>A battle between a pair of Green Woodpeckers
and a Great Spotted Woodpecker is
worth mentioning. It occurred on the 24th of
April. Passing through the middle of a wood,
I noticed a Great Spotted Woodpecker fly out
of a hole in an oak-tree. Shortly afterwards,
a pair of Green Woodpeckers settled near the
hole and then flew to some oak-trees close at
hand, where they were joined by their rival and
signs of hostility were soon apparent. Presently
the Great Spotted Woodpecker returned to the
hole and entered. Both of the Green Woodpeckers
then flew into the tree; and one of
them, settling upon the trunk, climbed up to
the level of the hole and, when it became
aware of the Great Spotted Woodpecker within,
extended its wings fully and proceeded to peck
viciously at its opponent. Whereupon there
was a scuffle at the mouth of the hole and
the Great Spotted Woodpecker hurriedly left.
After this, all was quiet and the Green Woodpecker
eventually descended and entered the
hole. The Great Spotted Woodpecker, however,
returned again, but, after fluttering around
the hole, disappeared, leaving the Green Woodpeckers
in possession.</p>

</p>

<p>In this varied field of hostile behaviour
which we have explored, one feature stands
out prominently, namely, that the interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
which a bird displays in other species varies
not only at different seasons but even from
hour to hour. I have used the word "nature"
as equivalent to "interest," and I have spoken
of the bird's nature changing or altering according
to the circumstances in which it was placed.
But its nature is its inborn constitution, and its
constitution cannot change from day to day,
still less from hour to hour. So that, in a sense,
and having regard to strict scientific accuracy,
it is misleading in this particular connotation to
say that the bird's nature changes.</p>

<p>What then does happen? The instinct of
pugnacity must form just as much a part of
the hereditary make-up of the migrant, when
on migration, as when finally it reaches its
destination; still more must it form part of
the constitution of the Bunting when it leaves
its headquarters temporarily and joins the flock.
And, if it is there, the question arises as to
why it does not respond. Now every instinct
requires for its response a stimulus of an appropriate
kind, and, therefore, a reasonable view
to take would be that the necessary stimulus
was lacking. But this is a view which we
cannot uphold, because on all these occasions
an opposing male was present&mdash;and, so far as it
is possible to judge by observation, that is the
stimulus which in the main evokes a hostile
response. We must therefore look elsewhere
than in its direction for a reason which will
adequately explain the behaviour.</p>

<p>Though it be true that every instinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
requires for its functioning a stimulus of an
appropriate kind, yet it is also true that the
condition which will render it responsive must
be present. What we have then to consider is
whether the phenomena which we have explored
give us any clue as to the particular nature of
that condition. In the first place, we have the
general fact that the hostility is not confined to
a few species belonging to a few families, but
that it is of wide application&mdash;birds of prey,
Warblers, Woodpeckers, all supply us with
evidence which serves to show, in greater or
less degree, its nature and extent. Next, we
found that the hostility was peculiar to a
certain season&mdash;and that one the season of
reproduction. And if the question were asked:
What condition would then be most likely to
render the instinct susceptible, the answer that
would most certainly be given would be&mdash;the
presence of a female. And in reply to a
further question as to the particular nature of
the stimulus to which the instinct would
respond, we should be told&mdash;the presence of
another male of the same species. Now the
possible influence of the female on the course
of the male's behaviour was the subject of
inquiry in the second chapter, wherein we
endeavoured to explain the hostility between
males of the same species, and we came to
the conclusion that it was not alone sufficient
to account for the facts disclosed. Still
less likely, therefore, is it that her presence
can bear any direct relation to the hostility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
between different species, the more so since
the biological end of securing a mate is
definitely excluded. And we have something
in the nature of proof of the correctness of
this view in the fact that she accompanies her
mate when he joins the flock, and that there
his instinct is not susceptible to stimulation.
We then proceeded to examine certain cases
in which all the indications pointed to the fact
that the "will to fight" was present in only
one of the opponents; and we attached considerable
importance to this circumstance, because
we knew from experience that the same bird
which seemed to lack courage, could at other
times and in other situations be most aggressive.
If then we ask what condition was present on
the one occasion that was absent on the other,
we have no difficulty in finding a reply&mdash;on
every occasion on which the opponents appeared
to be unevenly matched, one was in occupation
of a territory and the other was not. And if
we inquire further as to which of the two was
the aggressor, the answer is again clear, namely,
the bird that occupied a territory. Finally we
considered some particular instances in which
the "will to fight" was present alike in both
opponents, and in which the battles were
protracted and severe.</p>

<p>But the fact that a bird has established a
territory is not in itself sufficient to render its
hostile nature susceptible; it must be actually
in occupation if a response is to be elicited.
We reach this conclusion step by step: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
behaviour of the migrant, that lacks the "will
to fight" when on migration but is pugnacious
when it has secured a territory, shows it; the
behaviour of the resident, which temporarily
joins the flock and is there sociable, shows it;
and it is shown also by the determination with
which both opponents fight when the question
of ownership of a station is in dispute. And of
all the facts we have reviewed, this is perhaps
the most important in relation to our present
subject, for it demonstrates that the change
from sociability to hostility is not merely an
incident of the sexual season, not merely an
indirect result of the functioning of the general
disposition which leads to the establishment of a
territory, but that it is intimately associated
with the whole process, and that the particular
part of the bird's nature which is concerned is so
nicely balanced that it will respond under one
condition and one only.</p>

<p class="tb">Thus we are led to the only conclusion
which seems consistent with the facts, namely
that there is a relationship between the
"territory" and the hostility.</p>

<p>If we are satisfied that all this warfare is not
merely an expression of an instinct which is
serviceable in another direction, what part does
it play in the whole scheme of reproduction?</p>

<p>The young of many birds are delicate at
birth and unable to withstand exposure to cold,
and in the previous chapter we came to the conclusion
that the territory was serviceable in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
it provided an adequate supply of food in the
vicinity of the nest, and thus obviated the
necessity of the parents being absent from them
for long. But manifestly no matter how active
a male may be in driving away members of
its own sex and kind, it will neither make
its position secure, nor insure a supply of food
for its young, so long as any number of
individuals of different kinds are allowed to
establish themselves in the same space of
ground. On the one hand, then, we have the
fact that there is constant strife between males
of close affinity, whilst on the other, we know
that many species require like conditions of
existence and are bound to assemble wherever
these conditions are suitable; and we can infer
that the territory would fail to serve its purpose
if no restriction were imposed upon the measure
of such assemblies.</p>

<p>The question then arises: Does all this
warfare contribute towards the attainment of
reproduction? Not far from my house there is
a small water meadow, three acres in extent,
which for some years has been derelict and is
now overgrown with the common rush (<i>Juncus
communis</i>) and small alder trees. For three
successive seasons I watched the bird life of this
meadow, and more especially the Reed-Buntings
whose behaviour I was studying at the time.
In every respect the meadow was suitable for
this bird; there was an abundance of food and
numberless situations in which nests could be
placed. Each year all the pairs were successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
in rearing one, if not two broods, yet the
number of pairs never exceeded five&mdash;the first
year there were three; the second year five;
and the third year four. In addition to the
four pairs of Reed-Buntings, there were in the
spring of 1915, six pairs of Whitethroats, one
pair of Lesser Whitethroats, four pairs of
Willow-Warblers, one pair of Sedge-Warblers,
two pairs of Grasshopper-Warblers, one pair of
Chiffchaffs, three pairs of Hedge-Sparrows, two
pairs of Tree-Pipits, one pair of Skylarks, one
pair of Whinchats, one pair of Flycatchers, two
pairs of Song-Thrushes, one pair of Blackbirds,
one pair of Redstarts, three pairs of Chaffinches,
and one pair of Wrens&mdash;in all, thirty-five pairs,
whose young were mainly dependent for their
living upon the insect life of that meadow and
the ground immediately surrounding it. If we
allow three young to each pair&mdash;and this would
take no account of second broods&mdash;we arrive at
the following result, namely, that one hundred
and five young and seventy adults had to be
supplied with food from that locality, which
would mean, if the search for food were strictly
limited to that meadow, that 83 square yards
would be allotted to each individual.</p>

<p>Suppose now that the four male Reed-Buntings
had each admitted one other male,
and that they had secured mates, what would
have been the effect upon the whole community?
The four additional pairs with their young
would have represented twenty individuals,
which would have represented a decrease of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
8.5 square yards in the space allotted to each
individual. The pressure of the bird population
upon the means of support would then have
been materially increased; and not only the
Buntings, but the Warblers, Pipits, and all
the rest would have suffered. But the result
would have been the same if, instead of
the four additional male Reed-Buntings, four
males of other kinds had been allowed to
enter the marsh, and we can multiply the
number four until we arrive at a point when
the means of subsistence would no longer have
been adequate for the adults, still less for the
young. If, then, there were nothing to prevent
this happening, many of the birds in that
marsh would have no chance of rearing their
young successfully. Hence, if the territory is
adequately to serve the purpose for which we
believe it has been evolved, some provision must
have been included in the system to meet the
difficulty.</p>

<p>There are three ways by which this may have
been accomplished&mdash;indirectly, by increasing the
size of the area occupied by each individual,
and thereby reducing the relative number of
each species; or directly, by rendering the
fighting instinct of the bird susceptible to
stimulation by individuals of other species; or,
possibly, by a combination of the two. There
were four pairs of Reed-Buntings in the marsh,
and their territories covered the whole of it.
But inasmuch as other insectivorous birds were
established there also, and found sufficient food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to maintain both themselves and their families,
it is clear that the area these Reed-Buntings
occupied was in excess of that which they
would have required if they had been the sole
inhabitants. And such often appears to be
the case. Many a Warbler allocates to itself
a space of ground more than sufficient to supply
it with all that it needs; so, too, does the Finch,
or the Pipit, or the Falcon&mdash;if we take no
account of kindred species. Thus there is
reason to believe that, by limiting the number
of individuals in a given locality, this apparently
wasteful expanse of territory is serviceable in
that it provides against the pressure of the bird
population upon the available means of support
becoming too great. But though a reduction
in the numerical standing of the different species
would certainly follow from any increase in
the area occupied by the respective individuals,
and with even greater certainty would place
them in a more secure position as regards their
supply of food, yet, when we remember how
large a number are dependent upon a supply
of insect life for their young, we can understand
that it would not alone be a sufficient safeguard
against the dangers attendant upon overcrowding.
It is here, I believe, that we shall
find the true explanation of the hostility; it
roughly insures that the number of pairs in
any given area does not exceed the available
means of support, and indeed it is difficult to
imagine how such uniformity of distribution
as would free the young from the risk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
exposure could be obtained without some such
control.</p>

<p>Some birds, however, have no difficulty in
finding the necessary food for their young, yet
have great difficulty in finding a station where
they can rear their young in safety; and the
area each one occupies has been reduced
to the smallest proportions in order that the
maximum number can be accommodated. Here,
any increase in the size of the territory would
inevitably lead to the extinction of the race,
so that nothing stands between failure and
success except the ability of the bird to defend
its territory. If we study the bird population
at one of the breeding stations on the coast,
we find, generally speaking, that each kind of
bird inhabits a particular portion of the cliff; on
the lower ledges are the Guillemots and Kittiwake
Gulls; higher up are Razorbills and
Fulmars, and at the top, where the cliff is
broken and the face of the rock covered with
turf and soil, the Puffin finds shelter for its
egg. At the same time there is much overlapping;
the kind of ledge that suits a Razorbill
is equally suitable for a Guillemot or a
Fulmar, and so, no matter how successful the
Razorbill may be in establishing a territory
and preventing intrusion upon it by other
Razorbills, it will be all to no purpose if it
allows itself to be jostled out of its position
by a Fulmar. Hence, inasmuch as breeding
stations are limited and competition for territory
so severe, only those forms in which the fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
instinct responds freely to a wide range of stimuli
will be in a position to maintain a footing upon
the cliff.</p>

<p>In trying to estimate the importance of the
hostility in its relation to the territory, we must
bear in mind that competition varies in different
seasons and in different localities. The surface
of the land is constantly undergoing modification,
partly owing to human and partly to physical
agency&mdash;forests are cleared; marshes are drained;
the face of the sea-cliffs is altered by the erosion
of the waves; here the coast may be locally
elevated, there locally depressed; and so forth.
Many of these changes are slow and imperceptible,
many can be observed in our own
lifetime. The timber is felled and the undergrowth
cleared in some wood, and the following
spring we notice a change in the character of
the bird population. Migrants which formerly
found in it no suitable accommodation now
begin to appear, and as the seasons pass by
and the undergrowth affords more and more
shelter for the nests and an increasing supply
of insect life, so their numbers increase until
the wood becomes an important breeding station,
resonant with the song of many individuals.
But slowly the growth increases; the bushes
pass into saplings and the saplings into trees,
and the undergrowth then disappears just
as surely as do the migrants which can no
longer find there the conditions which they
require.</p>

<p>Or, as an illustration of the effect produced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
by natural agency, let me describe a change
which has taken place in a corner of Co. Donegal.
The promontory of Horn Head is bounded on
the west by extensive sand-hills, 100 ft. or more
in height. On the southern side it is divided
from the mainland by a channel, which narrows
down to 100 yards or so in width where it
fringes the sand-hills, and then widens out again,
covering an area of approximately 270 acres.
As far as is known in the memory of man, this
area has always been tidal. But in recent years
a change has taken place, and the blown sand
has silted up the channel, with the result that
this tidal area has been transformed into a
brackish lake. What has brought about the
change is not easy to determine. There is
evidence, however, of a slow alteration of the
level of the shore-line; for in the midst of the
sand-hills, situated 150 yards or so from the
present sea-margin, and running parallel with it,
there is an accumulation of pebbles some 3 feet
high by 4 feet deep. This raised beach is now
separated from the Atlantic by sand-drifts of
considerable height, and consequently there are
some grounds for believing that secular elevation
is taking place, which, if it be the case, will
account for the change in progress. Now the
effect on the bird population can be seen even
now, and will doubtless become more apparent
as the years pass by. Sand-Martins used to find
plenty of places to breed amongst the sand-drifts,
and moreover do so still. But their
nesting sites are constantly changing and dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>appearing,
and the breeding-place of one colony,
that was situated in the bank of a stream twelve
years ago, is now buried 10 feet or more below
the surface of the sand. The area that was once
tidal, but is now a brackish lake, is fed by
mountain streams, and as the fresh water
predominates, so in course of time will it become
fringed with vegetation; and instead of the
flocks of Curlew, Dunlin, and other waders that,
at low water, resorted there to feed, Coots will
fight with one another for the possession of
territories, and the Wild Duck will teach her
young to seek their food.</p>

<p>In whatever direction we turn, we find
that many breeding grounds are subject to
incessant change. Ancient haunts disappear,
new ones come into being, a change which
makes life impossible for this bird, as likely
as not benefits that one, and so on. There
is no stability. Hence in any given district
each recurring season there must needs be a
large number of individuals which are obliged
to seek new stations, and if there were no
control over their distribution, if each one
were free to establish itself wherever it chanced
to alight, this locality might be overcrowded
and that one deserted; and, bearing in mind
how many species there are that require similar
conditions of existence, we can infer that the
successful attainment of reproduction would
become impossible for many of those individuals
so long as each species was indifferent to the
presence of the others. On the other hand, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
there were no control over the range of the
intolerance, the smaller bird would have no
chance in competition with the larger, and it
is doubtful whether the larger would gain an
advantage commensurate with the energy it
would expend in ridding its area of the smaller.
I have described battles in which the opponents
were only distantly related; for instance, the
Moor-Hen will attack almost any bird&mdash;Partridge,
Lapwing, or Starling&mdash;that approaches its
territory even temporarily. Nevertheless the
antagonism between kindred forms is more
prevalent, and, as a rule, characterised by more
persistent effort; and thus it seems as if the
susceptibility of the fighting instinct has its
limitations, the degree of the responsiveness
being dependent upon the affinity of the
opponents.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we take an area inhabited
by a number of different species requiring like
conditions of existence, divide it into three
sections, and imagine that in one they were all
sociable, that in another they were all hostile,
and that in a third those which were closely
related were intolerant of one another. Let us
suppose further that each one of them was
represented by the full number of individuals
that the law of territory would allow. In
the first section an individual would establish
itself, and, becoming intolerant of its own
kind, would exercise dominion over an area
roughly sufficient, providing conditions were
normal, to insure an adequate supply of food for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
its young. But it would take no account of
other species, and since any number might
occupy the same ground, the fact of its having
established a territory would not alone suffice to
render its supply of food secure. Success in the
attainment of reproduction would then become
largely a matter of chance, depending upon the
number of individuals that happened to settle in
this place or in that. In the second section
there would be perpetual warfare; for whereas
the appropriate organic condition which leads to
pairing arises in different species at different
times, fresh claimants to occupied ground would
constantly be appearing, and the efforts of the
inhabitants to preserve their boundaries intact
would have to be maintained throughout the
whole period of reproduction; and while the
stronger or more persistent forms would be
more likely to breed, they would do so at the
expense of their young, to which they would be
unable to devote proper attention, and with an
expenditure of energy that would reflect itself
upon the future of the race. But the conditions
of life in the third section would be such as
would be more likely to yield good results.
The relations of the different members of the
community would be more evenly balanced, for
a male would only be called upon to compete
with those of its own size and strength. Thus,
on the one hand, accommodation would be so
divided as to secure the breeding of the maximum
number of individuals with the minimum
of expenditure of energy, whilst on the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
any undue pressure upon the available means of
subsistence would be prevented.</p>

<p class="tb">There can be no question that in the latter
section a higher percentage of individuals would
succeed in rearing offspring. And so, by reason
of the fighting instinct being more susceptible
or less susceptible according to the affinity of
the opponents, a control is established which,
while preventing unnecessary extension of warfare,
allows for sufficient extension to render the
biological end secure.</p>

<p>These, then, are the facts&mdash;this the conclusion
which can be drawn from them. It may,
however, be said of these facts, as it has been
said, with even less justification, of the battles
between individuals of the same species, that
they do not afford evidence of genuine hostility.
No doubt there are many naturalists who could
supplement these facts with others in which the
conflicts resulted in bodily injury, or terminated
fatally, or at least were of a more determined
kind. But I have already drawn attention to
the fact that, so long as a definite result is
attained, the severity of the struggle and the
amount of injury inflicted are matters of small
moment. Let us, however, run over the substance
of the argument, and then briefly refer
again to this point of view.</p>

<p>After enumerating instances of hostility,
sufficient in number, so it seemed, to constitute
reasonable ground for the belief that they had
a part to play in the life-history of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
individual, the two questions we set ourselves
to examine in this chapter were: Is there any
circumstance in the life behaviour of the
individual with which the hostility can be
definitely related; and, will the hostility lead
to the securing of a greater measure of success
in the attainment of reproduction?</p>

<p>Many different species assemble together in
winter and roam from place to place in search of
food. But in spring their behaviour undergoes
a remarkable transformation; they avoid one
another and become quarrelsome, so much so
that whereas the outstanding feature of the
winter is sociability, that of the spring is
hostility. With this general fact before us,
we proceeded to investigate this change of
behaviour still further. First of all we took
the case of a migrant, and, comparing its
behaviour, as it journeyed, with that when
finally it reached its destination, we found
that the bird which was notoriously pugnacious
when in occupation of a territory betrayed no
interest in other species as it travelled to the
accustomed breeding ground. Not only so, but
even though it was attacked, we found that
its pugnacious instinct still failed to respond.
Here, however, it may be contended, and with
reasonable justification, that in the interval
which elapses before the ultimate destination
is reached, some change in the organic condition
of the bird may occur which will account
for its altered behaviour; or, it may be urged,
with no less justification, that whereas on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
migration the bird is unpaired, when the
destination is reached it is probably in possession
of a mate and is therefore quarrelsome.
Now, at the most, the interval can only be
a matter of a few days, and it is unlikely
that organic changes sufficient to bring about
so important an alteration of behaviour could
occur in so short a time, still less likely that
they could be timed to come into functional
activity just at the moment when the bird
reaches its breeding ground. And with regard
to the suggestion that the change can be
accounted for by the presence of a mate, we
shall do well to remember not only that males
as a rule precede the females by some days, but
that a male may even remain in its territory,
mateless, for some weeks, and yet display
hostility.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the case of the migrant did not,
by itself, afford sufficient evidence upon which
to base any conclusion. We therefore inquired
into the behaviour of some of the residents at a
corresponding period. The Bunting served as
an illustration. Early in the season it establishes
a territory, and because food is then
scarce it is forced to seek it elsewhere than on
the small plot of ground which it has acquired;
and so it makes its way to some spot where
the supply is abundant, and there, meeting
with other species bent on a similar errand,
forms with them a flock. Part of its time is
then spent in the territory and part on the
feeding ground, and between these two points a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
highway is formed by the bird passing constantly
to and fro. But the attention which it pays to
other species is very different on these two
occasions&mdash;when in the territory it is intolerant
of strangers, but when it accompanies the flock
it displays no interest in their movements.
From hour to hour its nature seems to change.
But, as we saw, the inborn constitution of the
bird cannot change, and therefore we came to
the conclusion that an explanation of the altered
behaviour was to be found in the fact that the
pugnacious instinct is only rendered susceptible
under a certain condition. So that all the
evidence tended to confirm the impression which
we had gained from the course of events in the
life of the migrant, namely, that the hostility
bears a direct relation to the occupation of a
territory.</p>

<p>Finally we were led to inquire whether the
hostility was serviceable in promoting the
welfare of the individuals. We saw that many
different species require similar conditions of
existence, that ancient breeding haunts disappear
and that new ones come into being, and
that in the ordinary course of events such
species must often assemble in the same area for
the purpose of reproduction. So that even
though a male might be successful in protecting
its ground from intruders of its own kind, yet it
might still fail to rear offspring, just because it
happened to choose a position in which other
kindred forms had gathered. Hence if the
territory is adequately to serve its purpose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
some control over the local distribution of
species is of paramount importance. Nevertheless,
if all the different forms that require similar
conditions of existence were intolerant of one
another in a like degree, the smaller bird would
have no chance in competition with the larger.
This, however, is not the case. Some, as we
saw, arouse little or no animosity in others, in
fact the more closely related the rivals, the more
responsive their pugnacious nature seems to
become.</p>

<p>To return now to the view that the fighting
is not really serious, but, on the contrary, that it
is either vestigial and has no longer any part to
play in furthering the life of the individual, or
that it is a by-product of the seasonal sexual
condition to which no meaning can be attached.
First, there is the relationship with the territory,
and this, it seems to me, is a fact of some
importance; for if the fighting were merely an
exuberant manifestation of sexual emotion, one
would expect to find it occurring under all
conditions, and not merely under one particular
condition in the life of the bird. The hostility
is too widespread, however, and too uniform in
occurrence for us to suppose that it has no root
in the inherited constitution of the bird; and if
it served some useful purpose in the past, the
instinct might still persist, so long as it were not
harmful. Thus the view that the behaviour is
vestigial is not perhaps unreasonable. But
manifestly it makes no difference whether it be
vestigial or a by-product of sexual emotion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
whether the battle be fierce or so trivial as to
appear to us to be more in the nature of "play,"
so long as some change in the relative prospects
of the opponents is the result.</p>

<p>For us, then, the main consideration lies in
the question: Is the behaviour serviceable
now in furthering the life of the individual?
Whether the evidence which we have examined
affords sufficient ground for the belief that the
hostility is genuine and has a part to play in the
whole scheme of reproduction, each must judge
for himself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE RELATION OF THE TERRITORY TO
MIGRATION</h4>


<p>Coincident in time with the growth of
appropriate conditions in the environment,
organic changes take place rendering certain
instincts susceptible to stimulation; and the
stimulus being applied, the Warbler leaves the
country wherein it had passed the winter and
finds its way back, with apparently little
difficulty, to the district in which it was reared
or had previously reared offspring. What is
the nature of these changes and of the impulse
which is first brought into functional activity;
whence comes the stimulus; and what directs
the bird on its journey&mdash;these are all different
aspects of one great problem, the problem of
migration. I do not propose to discuss all these
various aspects, for indeed I have no suggestions
to offer which are in the least likely to be
helpful, but I seek rather to ascertain whether
the phenomena which we have explored bear
any relation to the problem as a whole;
whether, that is to say, the competition for
territory and all that appertains to it can have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
supplied the conditions under which, in the
process of time, this complex and definite mode
of behaviour has evolved.</p>

<p>We are sometimes told that we must seek
the origin of migration in the physical changes
that have occurred in the ancient history of the
earth&mdash;in glacial conditions which gradually
forced birds to the south, or in the "stability of
the water and mobility of the land" which
brought about a gradual separation of the feeding
area from the breeding area&mdash;and which
continued for a sufficient length of time to
lead to the formation of an instinct, and that
the instinct persists because it is serviceable
in promoting the welfare of the race. But
when we consider the lapse of time, and the
changes that must have occurred in the character
of the bird population&mdash;the appearance of new
forms and the disappearance of the old, the ebb
and flow of a given species in a given area&mdash;and
bear in mind that, notwithstanding this, the
migratory instinct, if not stronger, is assuredly
no less strong, and the volume of migration, if
not greater, is assuredly no less; in short, that
the whole phenomenon is progressive rather
than retrogressive, we shall find the view that
the instinct owes its origin to conditions which
no longer exist, receives but little encouragement.</p>

<p>I doubt not that, throughout the ages,
geological changes have been an important
factor in directing or limiting the scope of
migration, and moreover are so still; just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
climatic changes and the relative abundance or
scarcity of enemies have influenced the course
of its evolution. These are all contributory
factors operating in the external environment.
But there are, besides, internal factors which
form part of the inherited constitution of the
bird, and, being passed on from generation to
generation, afford the conditions under which
migration is constantly being renewed. It is, I
believe, in this field of organic change and
relationship that the conditions of origin must
be sought.</p>

<p>Just as the moth in passing from the rudimentary
to the perfect condition runs through a
series of changes, each one of which is marked
by a typical behaviour response adjusted to
meet some particular circumstance in the
external environment, so the annual history of a
bird displays an ordered routine, each phase of
which can be observed to correspond with one of
the successive changes in the environment. In
almost every direction, we find that this routine
is characterised, in broad outline, by great
uniformity; so much so that, providing we
know the history of one species, we can forecast
with no small degree of certainty the general
course of behaviour of other members of the
family. But only the <i>general</i> course. There is
endless variation in just the particular way in
which the behaviour is adapted to meet the
needs of particular species&mdash;the major details
may be said to be specific, the minor details
varietal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>Now it is that part of the behaviour routine
which has reference to the relationship between
one bird and another upon which, for the time
being, I wish to dwell; for the interest that
A displays in B is by no means always the
same&mdash;it changes according to the season, and
this change can be observed to be uniform
throughout a wide range of species.</p>

<p>In winter, in whatsoever direction we turn,
we observe not only that different individuals
but that different species also collect together
in flocks. And since food at that season is not
always easy to obtain, and, moreover, is only to
be found in certain situations, which are limited
both in number and extent, it would seem that
such assemblages are in the main determined
by accident. No doubt the abundance or the
scarcity of food does determine the movements
of birds, and hence to that extent may be held
to account for the flocks. But we shall but
deceive ourselves if we think that it is the sole
or even the principal reason, or that the situation
is in no wise affected by internal factors. The
behaviour of the individual in relation to the
flock bears ample testimony to the presence of
a gregarious impulse which derives satisfaction
from the fact of close association.</p>

<p>As an illustration, let us take a bird whose
movements are easily watched, and in whose
hereditary constitution the impulse to which I
allude seems to be strongly implanted&mdash;the
Curlew. When the breeding season is over,
Curlew leave the mountain and the moor and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
return to the coast or tidal estuaries for the
remainder of the year. Here, at low water, they
find an abundant supply of food&mdash;crustaceans
amongst the sea-weed upon the rocks, and lobworms
(<i>Arenicola piscatorum</i>) in the mud as the
tide advances or recedes. But when the tide is
full, they retire to those parts of the shore that
remain uncovered&mdash;to isolated rocks, or to sand-dunes,
or it may even be to pasture-land in the
neighbourhood. During this period of repose
large numbers of individuals gather together on
a comparatively small space of ground. They
are not constrained to do so by any shortage of
accommodation, nor by any question relative to
food, nor, for the matter of that, by any circumstance
in the external environment; they are
brought together solely, this at least is the
impression that one gains, by some inherited
impulse working towards that end. And their
subsequent course of behaviour tends to confirm
that impression. For if we watch the gathering
together of the different units of which the flock
is composed, and study more particularly the
emotional manifestation which accompanies their
arrival and departure, we shall find that the
coming of a companion arouses some emotion
which is expressed by a vocal outburst that
sweeps through the flock.</p>

<p>Now each call, and the Curlew has a great
variety, is not only peculiar, generally speaking,
to certain occasions, but is accompanied by a
specific type of behaviour, whence we can infer
in broad outline the type of emotion which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
aroused. Thus we come to recognise fear, anger,
or sexual emotion, by just the particular sound
which is emitted. But even if we are going
too far in referring particular calls to particular
emotions, we can, without a doubt, divide them
into two broad categories&mdash;those which are
pleasurable and those which are the reverse.
And we need have no hesitation in placing the
particular call to which I allude in the first of
these two categories, not only on account of the
nature of the sound produced, but because the
activities which are aroused are not such as
normally accompany irritation. This is well
seen if the behaviour of different individuals
be closely observed. After resting on one leg
for some time, first one and then another is
seized with cramp, and running a few yards
in an ungainly way, bumps up against its companions
as if it had not full control over its
movements. Its behaviour produces irritation
which is expressed by a vocal outburst, and
followed by actions the meaning of which is
clear. Moreover, the call is taken up by
other individuals and sweeps over part of the
flock as does the greeting. But the nature of
the cry is entirely different from that which
greets the arrival of a companion&mdash;humanly
speaking it is a passionate and impatient utterance,
the height of displeasure. The arrival,
then, acts as a stimulus to something in the
inherited constitution which is expressed in, and
presumably is satisfied by, this vocal outburst;
and, since the bird that arrives joins also in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
chorus, there is reason to think that the impulse
which determines its movements is similar to
that which is temporarily aroused in the flock.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the evidence derived
from the affective aspect of the operation of the
instinct, the general course of behaviour lends
support to the view that the assemblies are
determined by internal factors, and are not
merely the outcome of circumstances in the
external environment. Observe, for example,
the manner in which the flock is built up.
Single individuals are content to rest alone so
long as no assembly is in sight, but they are
drawn towards their companions directly the
opportunity arises, just as surely as the smaller
aggregation is drawn towards the flock; and so,
as the flock increases, it gradually absorbs all
the lesser flocks and smaller parties, for the
greater the flock the greater the attraction
seems to be; and different individuals appear
to gain some satisfaction from being in close
bodily contact with one another.</p>

<p>When the Curlew flies to that part of the
mud-flat which is first exposed by the receding
tide, and there associates with others, it does
not then do so because it has any interest in its
fellows, nor because they serve as an attraction,
but because it is constrained by hunger&mdash;in
other words, the association is determined by
accident. But when, during periods of repose,
it sees a flock, flies to it, and takes up a position
in the midst of it, it does so not because suitable
accommodation is lacking&mdash;not therefore because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
of external constraint&mdash;but because it derives
some pleasure from satisfying something in its
organic complex. We speak of this behaviour
and of the emotion which characterises it as the
<i>gregarious instinct</i>: by which we mean that the
inherited nature of the Curlew, as a tribe, is so
constituted that, given the appropriate internal
conditions and adequate external stimulation,
every individual will respond in a similar manner&mdash;that
is, the behaviour is primarily determined
by racial preparation. This is what we mean
by the <i>gregarious instinct</i> biologically considered.
We may resolve our own experience in relation
to the crowd into its simplest constituents,
project our own primitive feelings into the
Curlew, and say that the bird feels uneasiness
in isolation and satisfaction in being one of the
flock. But in truth we know nothing, save by
analogy, of the correlated psychical state. All
the knowledge we possess is derived from a
study of the objective aspect of the behaviour,
which in simple terms may be expressed thus:
the individual is drawn towards its companions;
there is a relation between the size of the flock
and the strength of the attraction; and all
Curlew behave similarly under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>This instinct controls the movements of
many birds from early autumn to the commencement
of the breeding season. And so
powerful is the control that the individual is
suppressed and its activities subordinated to the
welfare of the community as a whole. Flocks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
of Waders roam about the tidal estuaries in
search of food, and different kinds of Gulls
assemble there and preen their feathers or sleep;
Warblers alter their mode of life, and in the
osier bed, or amongst the elders, seek their food
together in peace; Finches, Buntings, Pipits,
and Wagtails, though food is everywhere
abundant, gather themselves together respectively
into bands which, as winter approaches,
grow into flocks and even into composite flocks;
and as the Warblers leave for the south, so their
places are filled by flocks of Thrushes and
Finches from the north. In whatever direction
we turn, when the days begin to shorten, it is
the community, not the individual, that thrusts
itself upon our attention; and throughout the
winter continues to be the outstanding feature
of bird life.</p>

<p>With the approach of the breeding season
we witness that remarkable change which I have
endeavoured to make clear in the previous
chapters&mdash;the disintegration of the flock and
the reinstatement of the individual. Instead
of continuing with the flock, the individual now
goes forth to seek the appropriate breeding
ground; and having arrived there, is not only
content to remain in isolation, but so behaves
that isolation is insured. Intolerant of the
approach of a stranger, intolerant even of the
approach of the very members of the community
whose companionship was previously welcomed,
it not only fights to maintain the position it has
selected, but fights indeed for the possession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
ground already occupied, and, until reproduction
is completed, asserts its individuality and exercises
dominion over its territory. What, then,
is the prospective value, biologically considered,
of the changing interest that A displays in B,
and to what will such changes lead? These are
the questions to which we will now direct
inquiry.</p>

<p>The annual life-history of a bird is in broad
outline conditioned by two powerful and at first
sight opposing impulses&mdash;the one to live in
society, the other to live solitary. But, manifestly,
a bird cannot be governed by opposing
impulses. It has but one character, within
which, according to the season and the circumstances,
different impulses predominate. But
these impulses, no matter how different they
may appear to be, have their respective parts to
play in furthering the life of the individual.
Hence they cannot oppose, though they may
conflict, if the resultant behaviour contributes
towards survival.</p>

<p>The majority of birds live to-day in constant
danger from predatory species, and that this
danger was still greater in bygone ages there
can be but little doubt. A curious mode of
behaviour of the Curlew, Whimbrel, and Godwit
demonstrates this, for it must be the outcome
of the necessity for constant watchfulness.
Whilst resting with its head turned back and
its beak buried in the feathers of the mantle,
the bird constantly moves the axis of its body,
so that an observer, if placed in a direct line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
behind it, sees at one moment the right eye
and at another the left. No movement of the
feet or of the legs is perceptible, and the shifting
of the body continues whether the eyes are
open or closed. This body movement enables
the bird to survey a much larger area of ground
than it would otherwise be capable of doing,
and thus adds to its security. As far as my
experience goes, the movement is less evident
amongst the members of a flock than when
an individual is resting alone, or even with a
few companions, which may be due to the fact
that since some members are always awake
and watchful, a bird of prey would have more
difficulty in approaching a flock unawares than
it would have in approaching a single individual.
With the greatest ease a Sparrow-Hawk can
pick up a Thrush as it feeds on the meadow
by itself, but if it attempts to seize one of a
flock, the chances are that its approach is
signalled and that its prey escapes. And not
only do the different members give warning
one to another of the approach of danger,
but they also combine to harass or even to
drive away an enemy. So that there can be
no doubt that the gregarious instinct is serviceable
in promoting the welfare of the race, and
has, as its end, the preservation of the individual
in order that it may take its share at the
appropriate time in procreating its kind.</p>

<p>In winter, then, the individual loses its
individuality and is subordinated to the welfare
of the community, whilst in spring it regains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
its individuality, and all its inherited instincts
which then come into operation lead to its
isolation from the flock. The impulse to seek
isolation is dependent upon internal organic
conditions which are peculiar to a certain
season; whereas the gregarious impulse depends
upon internal organic conditions which inhere
at all times, though its functioning is inhibited
by the functioning of the former impulse. The
evidence which leads to this conclusion is to
be found in the fact that a male often deserts
its territory temporarily and joins the flock,
where it remains at peace with its companions&mdash;an
aspect of behaviour which we have discussed
on various occasions. The former impulse becomes
dominant in the spring owing to its
innately superior strength; the latter becomes
dominant in the autumn because the organic
condition which determines the functioning of
the former then subsides. The impulse to
seek the appropriate breeding ground and to
dwell there would seem to be the strongest
of all the impulses save one&mdash;the sexual.
When, however, I speak of the sexual, I
refer to the actual discharge of the sexual
function, which is the consummation of the
whole process. But the territory and all that
appertains to it is part of that process&mdash;the
search for the breeding ground, the dwelling
there, and the intolerance of intrusion are but
different stages, each one of which must
have an impulse peculiar to it; and since the
completion of the sexual act can only be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
successfully accomplished providing that success
is attained at every stage, the probability is
that, of the impulses concerned, one is neither
more powerful nor less powerful than another.</p>

<p>So that we have two impulses operating at
different seasons and guiding the behaviour
into widely divergent channels. But though
the proximate end to which the behaviour is
directed is apparently different, there are not
two biological ends in view, but one&mdash;the
attainment of reproduction; and the changes
that we witness are not contrary but complementary,
and their prospective value lies in the
circumstance that they contribute towards the
preservation of the race.</p>

<p>If, then, every male is driven by inherited
impulse to seek the appropriate breeding ground
each recurring season; if, having arrived there,
it is driven to seek a position of its own; if,
in order to secure isolation it is obliged to
attack other males or to ward off the attacks
of intruders; if, in short, success can only be
attained providing that the inherited nature is
so adjusted that the bird can accomplish all
that is here demanded&mdash;what will be the general
result? That the individual will rear its offspring
in safety and that they will inherit the
peculiarities of their parents, enabling them,
in their turn, to procreate their kind; all this
will certainly follow. We are not concerned,
however, at the moment, with the direct effect
upon the individual, but with the consequences
that will accrue to the species as a whole.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>Now certain facts are presented to observation
which enable us not only to understand the
nature of the change that is wrought in the
history of the species, but to foreshadow, with
no small degree of certainty, the extent of that
change. I suppose that it has come within the
experience of most of us to observe, at one time
or another, the ebb and flow of a given species
in a given district. Some favourite haunt is
deserted for a year, or for a term of years, and
is then revisited; or, if it is always occupied,
the number of inhabitants fluctuates&mdash;plenty
of pairs in this season, only a few in that.
Many intricate relationships, both external and
internal, contribute towards this state of affairs.
Fluctuation in a downward direction, or
temporary extinction, is brought about by
changes in the physical world, by changes in
the available supply of food, by the increase
of enemies, or by adverse climatic conditions;
whilst fluctuation in an upward direction, though
due indirectly to a combination of circumstances
in the external world favourable to the survival
of large numbers of individuals, is directly
determined by the impulse to seek isolation.
As individuals of different species establish
themselves, and form kingdoms and lesser
kingdoms, we can watch the gradual quickening
into life of moorland and forest and we can
observe the manner in which it all comes to
pass. Males that for weeks or months have
lived in society, drifting from locality to locality
according to the abundance of food or its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
scarcity, now set forth alone and settle first here
and then there in search of isolation. Lapwings
settle in the water meadows, and, finding themselves
forestalled, pass on in search of other
ground; Blackbirds arrive in a coppice or in a
hedgerow and, meeting with opposition, disappear;
and the Curlew, wandering with no
fixed abode but apparently with a fixity of
purpose, searches out the moorland where it can
find the particular environmental conditions to
which its inherited nature will respond. In
fact, wherever we choose to look, we can
observe in a general way the gradual appropriation
of breeding ground; and if we fix our
attention upon particular males, we can watch
the method by which success or failure is
achieved.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion I have watched
the efforts of Reed-Buntings to appropriate
territories in a marsh that was already inhabited.
Sometimes their efforts met with success, at
other times with failure. In the former case,
the males, whose ground was intruded upon, were
severally forced to yield part of their holding
and were thus left in possession of a smaller
area. The success of the intruder seemed to
depend upon persistent determination, rather
than upon superior skill in battle. Recently I
had an opportunity of observing the intrusion of
a male Willow-Warbler upon ground already
occupied. By persistent effort it succeeded in
appropriating one half of the territory of its
rival. The intruder occupied some trees on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
outskirts of the territory it was invading, and
used them as a base from which it made
repeated efforts to enter the ground of its rival.
These efforts were time after time frustrated.
No sooner did it leave its base than it was seen
and intercepted, or else attacked; and no matter
from which direction it attempted to effect an
entrance, its efforts, for a time, were all to no
purpose. The fighting was of a determined
character, and after each attack the owner of
the territory showed signs of great excitement,
and, sitting upright upon a branch, spread and
waved its wings, which is the specific emotional
manifestation during the period of sexual
activity. Eventually the intruding male succeeded
by persistent effort in appropriating part
of the occupied ground.</p>

<p>Thus we can actually witness the efforts of
the individual to isolate itself from members of
its own kind, and can observe the immediate
consequences that follow from success or from
failure. And from these consequences we can
infer that, within a certain range but in accordance
with the relative abundance of the species
that dwell in it, every corner of the available
breeding ground will be explored and every
situation that evokes the appropriate response
will be occupied. Moreover, since the annual
dispersion is not merely a repetition in this
season of that which occurred in a previous one,
a progressive increase in the area occupied will
follow. Yet, if the majority of species desert
their breeding ground so soon as reproduction is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
ended, how can this be? An answer to the
question will be found in the fact that a bird
has an innate capacity to return to the neighbourhood
of its birthplace, or to the place
wherein it had previously reared offspring&mdash;which
means that the results of prior process
persist as the basis and starting-point of
subsequent process.</p>

<p>Bearing then in mind that the seeming
peace in bird life around us in the spring is
but the expression of transitory adjustments in
the distribution of individuals and of species;
bearing in mind how widespread is the search for
isolation each recurring season, how frequently
the search leads to competition and competition
to failure, and how failure implies a renewal of
the search; bearing in mind that situations,
which appear to be eminently suitable for
breeding purposes, are passed by year after year
and remain unoccupied, just because, for reasons
which have yet to be ascertained, the environment
fails to supply some condition which is
essential if the inherited nature of the bird is to
respond&mdash;can there be any doubt that the
general result of the functioning of the disposition
will be expansion; or, since no limit is
placed upon it from within but only from
without&mdash;that is, by unfavourable circumstances
in the external world, that the expansion will
not merely be in one direction but in every
direction?</p>

<p>If now, when reproduction is ended, all
the impulses relating to it die away, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
gregarious instinct again predominates, what are
the consequences to which this change will
lead? Just as the consequences which flow
from the functioning of the former impulse are
accessible to observation, so likewise can we
observe the change that is wrought by the latter
impulse. The process is a gradual one. Less
and less attention is paid by the individual to
intruders, more and more is it disposed to pass
beyond its accustomed limits. Little by little,
accompanied by its young or without them, as
the case may be, the bird deserts its territory
and wanders out into the wilderness. Here it
associates with others, and finds in them a new
interest and, I doubt not, a new enjoyment.
All this we can observe as it takes place. But
just as there is an innate capacity to seek, in the
spring, the place where the pleasures of breeding
had formerly been enjoyed, so we are bound to
infer the existence in the adult of an innate
capacity to revisit the former area of association;
and this capacity will strengthen and confirm the
gregarious instinct and set the direction of the
general course of movement.</p>

<p class="tb">We have seen, then, that the interest displayed
by one bird in another changes with
the seasons; we have seen that it is so modified
as to be in useful relation to different environmental
circumstances; as far as possible we
have traced out the consequences, and have
reached the conclusion that the change of
behaviour must, on the one hand, lead to
expansion, and on the other, to contraction;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
and we have seen that this conclusion is in
accord with the facts of observation&mdash;that is the
general result of our inquiry into the functioning
of the two powerful impulses, the impulse
associated with the disposition to secure a
territory and the gregarious impulse.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of migration embraces a
number of separate problems, each one of which
presents features of great interest and of still
greater difficulty. On some of these problems
I do not intend to touch; I seek only to
ascertain whether the impulses that are concerned
in the securing of a territory, and in the
search for society, bear any relation to the
problem as a whole. I hold that the origin of
migration is not to be found merely in conditions
peculiar to a remote past, but that the conditions
inhere in the organic complex of the bird,
and are thus handed down from generation to
generation. Starting with this assumption I
examined the behaviour which normally accompanies
the seasonal life-history of the individual,
and found, in that behaviour, manifestations of
cyclical change leading to definite biological
consequences. I now propose to inquire whether
those consequences are such as might, in the
course of time, give rise to the seasonal change
of abode.</p>

<p>We are apt to think of migration in terms of
the Warbler that enlivens our hedgerows in the
spring after travelling hundreds of miles from
the south, or of the Redwing that comes from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the far north and seeks its food during the
winter on the meadows, or perhaps of the
American Golden Plover that each year covers
a vast expanse of ocean in its journey from its
breeding ground. The length of the distance
strikes the imagination and constrains us to
focus attention upon the extremes.</p>

<p>But migration is of much wider significance
than is here represented. I sit beside the River
Severn in April and watch Swallows, Tree-Pipits,
and Yellow Wagtails passing in twos
and threes, in small parties, or it may be in
small flocks; and I observe that while some
establish themselves in the neighbourhood,
others pass on. Or I watch Herring-Gulls
returning to the breeding station at Bolt Head,
an endless stream of individuals coming from the
east as far as eye can reach; following them for
some miles inland I see them still, first as specks
upon the horizon, then passing beside me as
they beat their way slowly against the strong
south-westerly winds, and finally disappearing
from view in the direction of the cliffs. Or
again, I watch Buntings and Finches deserting
the flock and seeking stations in the marsh, or
amongst the furze-bushes on the common, or in
the spinneys. In each case the proximate end
of the behaviour is alike&mdash;wherein then lies
the difference? Only in the distance which
separates the territory from the area in which
the birds formerly associated. And intermediate
between the extremes, I doubt not, if we had
a sufficient body of observations, that we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
find numerous gradations, the lesser merging
step by step into the greater. Is the Swallow
a migrant and the Herring-Gull not; is the
Tree-Pipit a migrant and the Bunting not;
must a bird cross many miles of sea or of
land before it can be considered a migrant; is
the length of the distance traversed a criterion of
migration? Surely not. The distance traversed
is merely a collateral consequence of the process
as a whole.</p>

<p>The annual life-history of a bird presents, as
we have seen, two distinct phases&mdash;the one in
which the individual dominates the situation,
the other in which it is subordinated to the
welfare of the community. Let us take these
two phases separately and endeavour to see how
they may have influenced the seasonal movements;
and first let us take the more important
of the two, namely that one which is directly
concerned in the continuance of the race.</p>

<p>In this phase we must consider the three
factors to which allusion has already been
made:&mdash;(1) the internal impulse, (2) the innate
ability to return to the former breeding ground,
(3) the conditions in the external environment.
These three work in close relation and, as I shall
endeavour to show, lead to important results.</p>

<p>(1) If there were nothing in the inherited
nature beyond an impulse to seek the breeding
ground, if, that is to say, when the appropriate
locality were reached, the bird took no further
interest in the developing situation, the attainment
of reproduction would become largely a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
matter of chance. A male in a congested
district, having no incentive to seek fresh
ground, would remain inactive until a female
happened to cross its path and stimulate its
sexual impulse, when its activity would take
another form. Hence some districts would be
over-populated, whilst others would remain
unexplored. But the system of reproduction
does not consist merely of a search for the
breeding ground, and of the discharge of the
sexual function; it is a much more complex
business, yet withal more complete. Nothing
is left to chance; the end is attained step by
step; and each successive stage marks the
appearance of some specific factor which contributes
towards the success of the whole. We
start with the appropriate organic condition
under which, when adequate stimulation is
provided, the disposition to secure a territory
comes into functional activity. Within the
field of this disposition we can distinguish
certain specific impulses. In sequential order
we have the impulse to seek the breeding
ground; the appropriate situation which gives
rise to an impulse to dwell in it; and the act
of establishment which supplies the condition
under which the impulse to drive away intruders
is rendered susceptible to stimulation. Grouping
these impulses, for the convenience of treatment,
under one general heading, I speak of
an impulse to seek isolation. It implies some
kind of action with some kind of change as
its correlated effect; and from it there flows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
a ceaseless energy directed towards a definite
end which for us, who can perceive its prospective
value, is isolation in an appropriate environment.
The emphasis here is on "isolation," for it
involves competition, and there cannot be competition
without some change in the relative
positions occupied by different individuals; so
that in each recurring season there will be
not only a re-arrangement of ground formerly
occupied but an arrangement of ground formerly
deserted.</p>

<p>(2) That the older birds return to the
locality wherein they had formerly reared
offspring, and the younger to the neighbourhood
of their birthplace, was always deemed
probable. But in recent years evidence which
cannot be rebutted has been supplied by the
marking of birds. This evidence, details of
which can be found in the summary of results
published annually by Mr. Witherby in <i>British
Birds</i>, demonstrates that the adult frequently
returns not only to the same locality in which
it formerly bred, but even to the same station;
that it does so year after year; that this mode
of behaviour is not peculiar to one sex; and
that many of the young breed in the locality
in which they were reared. Such being well-established
facts, we can infer the existence of
an innate ability to revisit the place wherein
the enjoyment of breeding, or of birth, had
formerly been experienced. Of its nature we
know little or nothing. It would almost seem
as if there must be some recollection of past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
enjoyment, but all that can be definitely asserted
is&mdash;that past experience somehow becomes
ingrained in the life of the individual and
determines present behaviour. What, however,
is of importance to us at the moment is not the
<i>ad hoc</i> nature of the bird, but the biological
consequences to which the behaviour leads.
For if, on the average, individuals return to
their former haunts, it follows that the annual
dispersion will not be merely a repetition in this
season of that which had occurred in a previous
one, but that the little added this year will
become the basis for further additions in the
next. The innate ability is handed down from
generation to generation, and, in so far as it
contributes to success, is fostered and developed
by selection; and the modifications of behaviour
to which it leads, since the results of prior
process in the parent persist as the basis and
starting-point of subsequent process in the
offspring may in a sense also be said to be
handed down.</p>

<p>(3) The conditions in the external world may
be organic or inorganic. By organic I mean
the conditions which depend upon the number
of competitors or enemies by which a bird is
surrounded. The competitors may include other
species which require a similar environment; and
the enemies, species which prey upon it, or
animals which take its young or its eggs. They
vary in different seasons, in different districts,
and in nature and extent&mdash;the success of one
species leads to the failure of another, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
multiplication of the Jay or of the Magpie
robs us of many a songster.</p>

<p>By inorganic I refer to the changes in the
climate and in the surface of the earth. The
nourishment of the young depends upon a
regular supply of food, and the supply of food
depends upon the climate which alters in
different periods; in one decade the temperature
falls below, whilst in another it rises above,
the normal, and, as the insect life fluctuates,
so there is fluctuation in the bird population.
The changes in the surface of the earth are
manifold. Little by little the alder (<i>Alnus
glutinosa</i>) overspreads the marsh. Young
shoots spring up here and there, in a few
years grow into bushes, and in a few more
years are trees; and the dense masses of rush
which seemed to choke their growth, yielding
their position of importance, slowly disappear.
And where formerly the <i>Orchis latifolia</i>, <i>Orchis
mascula</i>, and <i>Juncus communis</i> grew in mingled
confusion, nothing but water, moss, and the
spreading roots of alder cover the ground.
As the rush disappears, many birds that for
generations have inhabited that marsh must
seek accommodation elsewhere. Ancient breeding
haunts thus disappear, new ones come into
being, and even those which appear to be
permanent are almost imperceptibly changing.</p>

<p>Now the bird inherits a nervous system,
which works under internal excitation and
external stimulation. Given the appropriate
organic condition and adequate stimulation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and the impulse to seek isolation comes into
functional activity. What the organic condition
is and how it arises we do not exactly know;
all we know is that organic changes do take
place in the breeding season, that these changes
profoundly modify character, and that they
correspond with the seasonal growth of the
sexual organs. And with regard to the question
of stimulation, we have again to confess to
much ignorance, although certain facts are presented
to observation which seem to indicate
the direction in which the stimulus lies. For
example, it is well known that abnormal climatic
conditions influence behaviour; we see migrants
retracing their flight along the very course they
travelled a short time previously&mdash;driven headlong
by the blizzard, that at least is what we
say. But if the wind, instead of being cold and
from the north, is warm and from the west, do
they retrace their flight? I have not found it
so. And if there be no wind and the temperature
is low, are they still affected? Again, I
have not found it so. When, as we commonly
say, they fly before the storm, some change
takes place in their organic complex, some new
impulse receives stimulation or the former one
lacks it. If, after Lapwings have established
themselves in their territories, the weather
becomes exceptionally severe, the birds collect
together again in flocks and revert to their
winter routine; and under similar circumstances,
Buntings fail to sing and temporarily desert
their territories. In such cases it is clear that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the impulse to seek isolation ceases for a time
to dominate the situation. The inference, therefore,
is that atmospheric changes bear some
relation to the functioning of the instinct; but
whether it be temperature, or humidity, or the
direction and velocity of the wind, or a combination
of two or more of these factors that supplies
the stimulus, we cannot tell.</p>

<p>The appropriate organic condition and the
stimulus have then still to be determined, and
we must pursue our inquiry from the point at
which the impulse comes into functional activity.
We will take a simple case, and one free from
complication.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that there is an area bereft
of bird life, if it can be so imagined, but in
proximity to other inhabited areas. Into this
area, whilst in search of isolation, let us imagine
that a Yellow Bunting finds its way. After the
manner of its race it establishes a territory and
occupies, let us say at a low computation, half an
acre of ground. It then obtains a mate, breeds,
and rears offspring, two of which we will assume
are males. Reproduction ended, the birds desert
the area, and in the following spring, when the
impulse again asserts itself, parents and offspring
seek again their former haunts. We now have
three males, each of which occupies half an acre,
and each of which rears two offspring&mdash;that is the
position at the close of the second year. In the
third year the number will have increased to
nine and the area occupied to 4&frac12; acres; and so
on in succeeding years, until by the beginning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the eleventh year, we have 59,048 Yellow
Buntings occupying 29,524&frac12; acres or 46 square
miles. This, then, will be the result of the
operation of the impulse, providing that all the
individuals survive and that no complications
supervene.</p>

<p>But of course complications are numerous,
some of which retard while others accelerate the
rate of expansion. These complications arise
from various sources&mdash;in the first place from
natural enemies which prey upon the birds or
upon their eggs; in the next place from climate
which, if it happens to be unfavourable, may
mean that food is scarce and that only a small
percentage of the young survive; and lastly
from rivals&mdash;and by rivals I mean closely related
forms that require a similar station and similar
food&mdash;which, by occupying available ground,
may check expansion, or, by forcing a continuation
of the search, may widen it.</p>

<p>Now when individuals fail as many do fail
in their initial attempt to secure territory, the
activity of the impulse still persists, and there is
no control over the direction in which the bird
continues to wander whilst in search of its end.
Some therefore seek in this direction, others in
that; some wander inwards into inhabited areas
and fail to find accommodation, or, according to
the relative strength of their impulse, perhaps
succeed and so set free a new competitor,
others wander outwards into country uninhabited
by the species. These latter we will
call "pioneers." They may find accommoda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>tion
within a comparatively short distance of
their base, or they may come into competition
with rivals and fail, not necessarily on account
of any congenital weakness of ability, but
because being warned by an alien song, they
may be precluded from coming into contact
with just the environing conditions which can
supply the stimulus and allow behaviour to run
its further course&mdash;and so be obliged to extend
their search into remoter districts. But it must
not be overlooked that they will be placed in a
most advantageous position so far as the attainment
of reproduction is concerned. In their
search for territory they will meet with little
opposition and will be free to select whatsoever
ground they will; and be free also from
intrusion by neighbouring males, which is so
frequent in occurrence and continues for so
long in congested areas. Moreover, in thinly
populated districts, the pressure upon the
available means of support will not be so
great, neither will natural enemies be so plentiful;
and since the offspring, guided by prior
experience, return to the neighbourhood of
their birthplace, the advantages thus gained
will be shared by the succeeding generation.
It follows, then, that the range of a species
will not always be continuous, will not, that
is to say, proceed by a series of successive
steps, but that sometimes in this direction and
at other times in that, the chain of territories
will be interrupted and different individuals
separated by distances of greater or lesser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
extent. New colonies will thus come into
being; and as the unlimited increase of the
population over limited areas gradually reintroduces
into them the struggle for territory, new
centres of distribution, where the process will
repeat itself and from which expansion will
proceed afresh, will be formed. Hence, though
it is clearly impossible for the progeny of one
pair of Yellow Buntings to overspread the whole
of the 46 square miles, it is by no means impossible
for the limits of their range to exceed even
those limits within the eleven years.</p>

<p>To sum up our knowledge regarding this
phase. Of the organic condition which renders
the impulse responsive to stimulation we know
very little; and though certain facts of observation
seem to indicate the direction in which the
stimulus is to be found, we must here again
confess to much ignorance. So far as can be
seen, however, the impulse to seek isolation
with its correlative territory, leads to constant
modification in the breeding range of most
species. The occupation of the small space of
ground which each individual requires, the
extent of which has been gradually adjusted to
suit the needs of different species, results in
expansion not only in one direction but in every
direction, and not only in one season but in every
season. And if there were no complications in
the external world this expansion would proceed,
as we have seen, with astonishing rapidity. But
complications, some of which are favourable and
others unfavourable, are numerous, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
difficult to estimate their importance or to
indicate their precise effect; the former, however,
accelerate the rate of expansion, whilst the
latter retard it. Those individuals that wander
outwards and seek territory on the outskirts of
the range we have called "pioneers." They will
have advantages over others that, wandering
inwards, seek isolation in congested districts,
and will succeed where the latter fail; and since
there is in the young an innate ability to
return to the district wherein they were reared,
the advantages so gained may be said to be
handed on from generation to generation.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the contra-phase, and
endeavour to ascertain whether the gregarious
instinct bears any relation to the seasonal
desertion of the breeding ground. The conclusion
at which we have already arrived regarding
this instinct is that it forms part of the inherited
nature of most species; that its functioning is
suppressed when a bird is actually in occupation
of a territory; and that it is serviceable in promoting
the welfare of the individual. We
cannot of course observe the instinct. What
we observe, when reproduction is ended, is a
change in the relations of different individuals;
instead of arousing mutual hostility, they attract
one another, from which we infer the existence
of something which determines their conduct,
and this "something" we speak of as an
instinct.</p>

<p>To what does this change lead? Let us
suppose that there is an area inhabited by one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
species; that the number of inhabitants has
reached the maximum that the means of
sustenance will allow; and that the season
of reproduction is drawing to a close. The
position will then be as follows. All the
available breeding ground is divided into territories;
each territory is occupied by one unit,
the family, and each individual is able to fend
for itself; changes both internal and external
begin to take place, the gregarious instinct
comes into functional operation, and the supply
of food diminishes&mdash;that roughly is the position.
The internal factor operates so that the sight
of this individual or the call of that, instead of
evoking hostility as heretofore and keeping
different units apart, proves now an irresistible
attraction; so that in place of a number of
individuals evenly dispersed over the whole of
this area, a small number of flocks of various
dimensions are stationed at certain points, which
points are determined partly by experience,
partly by the supply of food, and partly by
accident. This implies for each individual some
movement in some direction. But since the
population of this imaginary area has reached
the maximum, and the supply of food, though
limited in distribution, is nevertheless plentiful,
such movements will be irregular and will proceed
in no definite direction.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that the breeding range
extends and that fresh ground is occupied by
pioneers. When reproduction and the rearing
of broods are ended and the gregarious instinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
becomes dominant, these pioneers, or at least
some of them, will revisit the area wherein
formerly they associated with companions.
Their offspring, however, though they will
have the inherited impulse and the innate
tendency, will not have the experience; how
then will they behave? There can be no doubt
that some will accompany the older birds, and,
being led by them, will share the experience of
a former generation; nor any question that
others will collect together in the neighbourhood
of their birthplace and, if their impulse is
satisfied, will remain there so long as food is to
be found. Thus the gregarious instinct, working
in close relation with acquired experience,
will on the one hand lead to the formation of
organised movements in certain directions,
whilst on the other it will lead to the formation
of new areas of association which will follow in
the wake of the expansion.</p>

<p>We have assumed, in the imaginary case
which we have just taken, that the conditions
in the external world are such as enable the
birds to endure throughout the year&mdash;in short,
that there are no complications regarding the
supply of food. But we must bear in mind
that so long as conditions are favourable during
the period of reproduction, which is of short
duration, the breeding range can continue to
expand, and that therefore, in the course of
centuries, regions will come to be occupied
wherein, owing to alternations of climate or
physical changes in the surface of the earth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
food will be impossible, or at any rate difficult
to obtain at certain seasons. Hence there will
come a time when the area of association ceases
to follow in the wake of the expansion, and
the breeding area begins to diverge from the
subsistence area.</p>

<p>How, then, is the gulf between these two
areas to be bridged? We can of course say
that those individuals which, in virtue of some
slight variation of hereditary tendency, return
to regions where food is plentiful will survive;
whilst others, less well endowed, will perish.
We can state the position in some such general
terms, and doubtless there would be truth in
the statement, but it does not carry us far;
we wish to know more of the nature of the
tendency, and of the manner in which it has
evolved. Well now, in this new situation
which arises, two things are apparent&mdash;that
the struggle for existence becomes a struggle
for the means of subsistence, and that anything
in the inherited constitution of the bird which
can be organised to subserve the biological end
in view becomes of selection value. So long as
food can always be procured in the new areas of
association, the individuals that behave in
accordance with ancestral routine gain thereby
no particular advantage; but directly the
breeding range extends into regions where
the supply fluctuates, traditional experience
becomes a factor in survival, and those individuals
that come under its influence will, on
the average, be more likely to endure and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
to procreate their kind and maintain the
tradition. Let it once be granted that there
is an innate capacity to retain in later phases
of routine the experience gained in earlier
phases, and it is difficult to see how traditional
guidance can be refused recognition as a factor
in the developing situation. But only <i>a</i> factor,
and by no means the most important one; for
observation has shown that the young are
capable of performing the return journey
without guidance. Something therefore <i>is</i>
inherited, some impulse which comes into
functional activity at a specified time, and leads
the bird to set forth in a given direction.</p>

<p>There are no grounds for supposing that
the experience of one generation forms any
part of the hereditary equipment of subsequent
generations. In what direction then are we to
look for the congenital factor? What is given
is an inherited tendency to co-operation and
mutual help, and an innate capacity to make
use of the results of experience. The inherited
tendency, as we have seen, leads on the one
hand to the formation of new areas of association,
whilst on the other, since it is the means
of bringing isolated individuals into contact,
it leads to experience being handed on from
generation to generation, which, in its turn,
results in a certain amount of backward movement
along the line of expansion. It forms
part of the hereditary equipment of many
species, and is serviceable in promoting the
welfare of the individual. Moreover, there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
reason to believe that its origin dates back to
an early period in the evolution of the higher
forms of life; and if in the subsequent course
of evolution it could have been so organised
as to serve a double purpose, so much the more
reason would there have been for its survival.
In what does the instinct consist? Is it merely
that the sight of this individual or the call of
that proves at some particular moment an
irresistible attraction, or does the appropriate
organic condition give rise, as is generally
supposed, to some preceding state of uneasiness?
In the former case, the temporarily isolated
individual or colony would have but little
chance of sharing in the benefits which mutual
association confers upon the associates; in the
latter, the feeling of discomfort would lead to
restlessness, and would thus bring the bird into
touch with the environing circumstances under
which instinctive behaviour could run its
further course. So that it is probable that the
movements of each individual, prior to its
becoming a unit in the flock, are not accidental
but are determined in some measure by racial
preparation.</p>

<p>Now if the fundamental assumption of the
doctrine of the struggle for existence be true,
the gregarious instinct will not be quite alike in
all the members of different broods, nor even in
each member of the same brood; that is,
variation will occur in all possible directions.
And we shall not, I think, exceed the limits of
probability if we assume that different individuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
vary in the persistency with which they strive
to attain their unknown end, and in the direction
in which they travel in pursuit of it. So that in
each generation they will fall into three classes:
(1) those which are inert, (2) those which
wander along the line of expansion, (3) those
which wander in other directions. If then the
struggle for life at this particular juncture in the
evolution of the breeding range is a struggle for
the means of subsistence, the members of these
three classes will not be in a like satisfactory
position so far as the competition for food is
concerned. Those in the first class&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, those
in which the activity feelings are weak&mdash;will
neither gain the benefits which arise from
mutual help, nor will they have much prospect
of enduring through the season of scarcity.
Those in the third class will, it is true, derive
some assistance one from another, and so be in
a better position to discover what food may be
available; but inasmuch as they will remain in
regions where the climate alternates and the
supply of food is liable to fall below the
minimum required, the chances are that a high
percentage will fail in the struggle for existence.
We come now to those in the second class, and
it is upon them that I wish more particularly to
focus attention. The initial movement in their
case will be in the direction from which outward
expansion has all along taken place. Within a
comparatively short distance they will reach
districts where the species is plentiful, and here,
associating with others that have some traditional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
experience, they will be guided by them and
will find themselves in regions where food is
plentiful. Hence in each generation those will
survive that, owing to some congenital variation
of their instinct, seek satisfaction for their
impulse in a direction which brings them under
the influence of tradition. And though at first
but slight and not in themselves of survival
value, such variations, since they coincide with
modifications of behaviour due to acquired
experience, will be preserved and in the process
of time so accumulated as to be capable of
determining the direction and extent of the
movement.</p>

<p class="tb">But the young Cuckoo deserts this country
many weeks after its parents, and there is no
reason to suppose that it lives in society when
eventually its destination is reached; and the
young Falcon passes to the south, and is
certainly not gregarious&mdash;how then can we
explain their behaviour in terms of something
which they show no signs of possessing? I do
not wish to make light of a difficulty which
admittedly, at first sight, is a grave objection to
the view that the gregarious instinct has been
operative in the manner here claimed for it. It
must, however, be borne in mind that this
instinct, though originally developed to serve
the purpose of mutual protection, supplies the
material upon which evolution works when the
extension of the breeding range creates a
situation requiring readjustment on the part of
the organism to new conditions of life; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
those variations which can be so modified as to
be in useful relation to the new environmental
circumstances are seized upon by natural selection
and, being transmitted, form the foundation of
a specific inherited response, no longer dependent
upon, though operating in close relation with
the primitive response whence originally it
sprang. Thus the primordial instinct becomes
so organised as to serve a secondary purpose,
that of rendering secure a means of access to
a certain food supply. In the course of evolution
species were bound to arise which, owing
to some peculiar conditions, derived greater
advantage from living solitary than from living
in society. Does it then follow, because such
species manifest no inclination to live in society,
that the instinct never has played any part in
their lives? Or because the primary purpose
has lapsed, does it follow that the secondary
no longer exists?</p>

<p>Let me recapitulate the principal considerations
which I have discussed in this chapter.</p>

<p>Though I have been advancing a theory, and
though I have taken much for granted, yet it
will, I think, be admitted that both the theory
and what has been taken for granted rest on
observational grounds. As our starting-point
we have a bird whose inherited nature alternates
according to the season, and in whose nature we
can distinguish two contra-phases&mdash;the one to
live in society, the other to live solitary. While
both have their part to play in furthering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
life of the individual, for biological interpretation
there is only one end, the prospective value of
which is the continuance of the race. We may
say that the latter phase is the more important
of the two because it is directly concerned with
reproduction. But we shall make a great mistake
if we attach peculiar importance to one
phase, or to one mode of behaviour within that
phase, or to one action within that mode of
behaviour; for if there is one thing certain it is
that the whole is an inter-related whole in which
each part depends for its success upon that
which precedes it.</p>

<p>In that phase in which the territory is the
central feature of the situation, the struggle
for existence is in operation in its acutest form;
all the congenital and acquired capacities of the
bird&mdash;pugnacity, song, capacity to utilise in
later phases the experience gained in prior
phases, all these are organised to subserve an
end&mdash;a proximate end&mdash;which in its simplest
terms may be described as "isolation." Isolation
is then the first step in the process of reproduction,
and any individual that fails to make it
good, fails to procreate its kind. But isolation
implies separation, and the degree of separation
varies in different species, from the few square
feet of cliff required by the Guillemot to the
few square miles of barren moor over which the
Peregrine exercises dominion. One species must
occupy sufficient ground to enable it to secure
food for its young; another requires sufficient,
but no more, upon which to deposit its egg; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
a third must secure a position for its nest within
the community. Hence it follows that the
degree of separation varies with the conditions
of existence. Since, however, the conditions in
the external world are constantly changing
according to the relative abundance or scarcity
of enemies, the rise or fall of rivals, the physical
changes in the earth's surface, and the alterations
of climate, it is clear that isolation can only be
obtained with difficulty, and that the competition
for it must be severe. Some individuals
therefore fail to breed, whilst others, perhaps
because their impulse is stronger, persevere
and seek stations elsewhere. What are their
prospects of finding them? By extending the
field of their activities, they will wander into
districts remote from the scene of competition,
districts where not only food is plentiful but
where enemies and rivals are scarce; and to
these pioneers, if to any, success in reproduction
will most certainly be assured. But not only is
it they who will benefit; their offspring also,
when the time comes for them to take their part
in the maintenance of the race, will share in the
success of their parents, for even though they
may not escape competition from individuals of
closely related forms, they will meet with but
little from those of their own kind. Now
species which live throughout the year in the
vicinity of their territory are comparatively few,
the majority are obliged to wander in search
of food so soon as reproduction is ended, and
their behaviour is determined not only by its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
abundance or scarcity, but also by the powerful
gregarious impulse which waxes in proportion
as the instincts connected with reproduction
wane. If, then, when the sexual instinct again
becomes predominant, the experience of the
former season nowise affects their movements,
little or no progress will be made in the expansion
of the range. But just as a certain entrance
into the bush and pathway through it, when
once made use of in the process of building,
becomes so firmly established as to form the
sole highway to and from the nest, so likewise,
when the impulse to seek isolation repeats
itself, the bird is constrained to seek the
neighbourhood wherein it had experienced the
enjoyment of breeding or of birth. Thus the
little that is added one year becomes the basis
for further additions in the next, and new
centres of distribution are continually being
formed from which expansion proceeds anew.</p>

<p>Now as the range gradually extends into
regions where the climate alternates and food at
certain seasons is consequently scarce, the
distance between the customary area of association
and that of reproduction must perforce
widen. The question then arises: How will the
young that have no experience find their way to
regions wherein they can endure? The forces
which may have been organised to subserve the
end in view are three: (1) Acquired experience,
(2) tradition, (3) the gregarious instinct. The
pioneer that carries the range a little further
forward starts from a base where it has associated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
with companions and found food plentiful; and
when the impulse to live in society again asserts
itself, it not only repeats its former experience
but hands on the habit thus acquired to those of
the next generation that happen to accompany
it. Granting, however, that by successive
increments in the distance traversed, traditional
guidance may in time accomplish much, it
cannot account for all the known facts, it
cannot at any rate explain the fact that in some
cases the inexperienced offspring finds its way
to the food area without guidance. Something,
therefore, <i>is</i> inherited. And my suggestion is
this: That the gregarious instinct, the ancient
origin of which we can infer from its manifestation
in so many and diverse forms of life,
supplies the material upon which evolution
works; that variations of the initial impulse, at
first slight and not in themselves of selection
value, in so far as they coincide in direction with
modifications of procedure due to experience or
tradition, are preserved; and that, in the process
of time, they are so accumulated as to form
a specific congenital endowment determining
a definite mode of behaviour.</p>
